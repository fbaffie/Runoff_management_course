[Quiz](01_Hydrology/1_water_cycle_quiz.html)

"Hydrology is the science which deals with terrestrial waters, their occurrence, circulation and distribution on our planet, their physical and chemical properties and their interaction with the physical and biological environment, including the effect on them of the activity of man".



Session time plan:
- Brainstorming:

Ask students to prepare a sketch of the water cycle. They put their name on the backside of the sheet.
Keep each student's sketch, make a copy and put it on the website.

- Discuss the student's suggestions and create a master-sketch on the board.

What other "cycles" do they know? should we have a catch-up on the carbon cycle? How are the different cycles inter-related?

This is a good opportunity to see what was forgotten and small discussing the relative importance of each element.
Introduce numbers now, or get students to estimate some of them.

Exercise on R: 
Sogndal catchment using historical data: catchment size, catchment altitude, catchment mean slope, % of the various land uses, mean annual flow, mean annual snow cover at Anestølen (how many days of snow cover), how many days of precipitation? mean precipitation, median precipication, mean glacier ablation rate, cumulated glacier ablation rate.

Hydropower reservoirs can store substantial amounts of water and can therefore be managed specifically to avoid flooding downstream.
Flood forecasting becomes particularly important as a reservoir may first need emptying before acting as a damper to a flooding event. We will focus on a case study in Zürich, Switzerland.

<!-- KYRRE
- Start with brainstorming keywords and a conceptual sketch
- Exercises on the network in Sogndal and the potential / difficulties associated with green infrastructure in Sogndal / Norway.
Get students to brainstorm on potential green infrastructure techniques. Then list a few and ask them to draw how they think those features should be designed.
Then present some typical drawings, discuss and get them to explore further for the next session.

<h2>Green SW infrastructure</h2>

[Lecture](04_Urban_SW/2_constraints.html)
--></p>
<p>Lecture by Eli Heiberg (HVL)</p>
<p>Role of green infrastructure in urban storm water management:</p>
<p>Principles, measures and technology for local, open runoff management. We will also discuss the multifunctionality of green infrastructure.</p>
<!-- ELI

This session will focus on green SW infrastructure and their non-physical design constraints.
Those include cost and maintenance issues, social acceptance, multifunctionality (depollution, recreation, agriculture).
What are the responsibilities of decision makers regarding the design of such infrastructure?
Which official design guidelines exist and why do they matter?

- Quiz: discuss paper "Stormwater management and urban planning:Lessons from 40 years of innovation"
- Lecture topics:
National guidelines in development
Maintenance aspects
Social acceptance (recreational use, ready to do some maintenance?, understanding of the risks)
Relation between private developers, private design firms and municipalities (do all waters assets typically get vested to council in Norway?)
Do the municipalities have specific requirements for new developments? If not, what should they do and how?
Constructive critiscm on the blue/green factor method could be used as an exercise.
- Exercises or maybe project presentation / discussion as this session might come early in the course

<h2>Designing resilient infrastructure</h2>
<p><img src="images/logo.PNG" class="cover"> <!-- [Lecture](04_Urban_SW/3_design.html) --></p>
<p>We look at some good and bad design examples and try to understand the reasons behing design choices and possibly unintended consequences / uses.</p>
<p>Some examples focus on SW infrastructures but not all, in an effort to distinguish important design principles and constraints. This includes legibility. practicality, multi-functionnality…</p>
<!--
Quiz / exercises on design calculations / drawings (redesign the campus?)
Or ask everyone to come with 1 example of good and bad design on the campus (or in Sogndal). Could be water-related but also other.
The example of bad design should come with a suggested better option.
- Brainstorming:
Ask students to brainstorm their ideas on good design principles for resilient SW infrastructure / water resources management
- Lecture linking all previous elements: hydrology, hydraulics, non-technical constraints.
- Design exercises

<p>The goal is to complete exercises 1, 2 and 3 suggested by Jan Seibert with the hydrological model <a href="https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/h2k/Services/HBV-Model.html">HBV Light</a>. The program, accompanying data and an introduction lecture to the model can be accessed on the University of Zürich, Department of geography <a href="https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/h2k/Services/HBV-Model/HBV-Download.html">webpage</a> You can try to install the software on your laptop but there was a resolution problem on mine. Otherwise, the program is installed on the computers of room: F-208 Kjelda</p>
<p>Two exercises using the hydrological model HBV light (see <a href="https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/h2k/Services/HBV-Model/HBV-Download.html">introduction lecture and manual</a>):</p>
