<h2>Course plan</h2>
<p><img src="images/PPT_Body.PNG" class="cover"></p>
<p>Approximately half of the course will be focused on the basics of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrology: how rainfall becomes streamflow?</li>
<li>Hydraulics: how water moves in open channels and under pressure?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before looking at two quite disctinct scenarios (in Norway):</p>
<ul>
<li>Catchment scale flooding: how to deal with large-scale flooding?</li>
<li>Urban stormwater (SW) and flooding: how to best manage urbanized catchments?</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the different components in the hydrological cycle and local water balance</li>
<li>the challenges and possibilities related to local runoff management</li>
<li>erosion and sediment transport in catchments and related mitigation measures</li>

<h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source text-based material (for collaboration), available <a href="https://fbaffie.github.io/Runoff_management_course/">online</a></li>
<li>Links to a lot freely available material</li>
<li>Lots of questions to force thinking / active learning</li>
<li>Open to a variety of projects this year</li>
</ul>
<p>Given those course design choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be active: take part in brainstorming exercises and questions</li>
<li>Be creative in your projects</li>
<li>Don’t hesitate to ask questions and reach for help</li>
<li>Give feedback: The course is a living document, please suggest improvements!</li>

<!--
1.  Intellectual Community
2.  A high degree of interactivity between instructor and student, as well as between students.
3.  Active Learning
4.  Reflection
5.  Self-directed Learning

This master programm introduces you to a lot of material, which is good to give you different perspectices and widen your horizons, but it presents the risk of covering too supercially key concepts.
In order to achieve the difficult balance between those 2 aspects, I have choosen to have simple lectures on important processes and concepts, backed by group exercises on specific case studies or scientific findings. A substantial list of written and video resources is listed at the end of each topic.

It is a bit hypocritical to tell you not to do copy/paste, as I do it and it is very human to do it...
My role is to orient you in the best way to book and interent resources for the future, while forcing you to have some internet-free discoveries during the course. The wealth of information available to us is both a miracle and a curse!

Mark said that students were lacking pro-activity. He was maybe right.

Implementing change requires strong convincing / argumentation abilities. Developing alternative ways to manage stormwater is for example much more difficult from an organizational point of view than from a technical aspect.

"Hydrology is the science which deals with terrestrial waters, their occurrence, circulation and distribution on our planet, their physical and chemical properties and their interaction with the physical and biological environment, including the effect on them of the activity of man".

Session time plan:
- Brainstorming:

Ask students to prepare a sketch of the water cycle. They put their name on the backside of the sheet.
Keep each student's sketch, make a copy and put it on the website.

- Discuss the student's suggestions and create a master-sketch on the board.

What other "cycles" do they know? should we have a catch-up on the carbon cycle? How are the different cycles inter-related?

This is a good opportunity to see what was forgotten and small discussing the relative importance of each element.
Introduce numbers now, or get students to estimate some of them.

Exercise on R: try to do general functions that could quickly be used with other catchments (I NEED TO PREPARE A PARAMETRIZED NOTEBOOK) 
Sogndal catchment using historical data: catchment size, catchment altitude, catchment mean slope, % of the various land uses, mean annual flow, mean annual snow cover at Anestølen (how many days of snow cover), how many days of precipitation? mean precipitation, median precipication, mean glacier ablation rate, cumulated glacier ablation rate.

Why does it rain more in Fjaerland than in Sogndal? Why is it warmer...

- Quick lecture on what was not covered
- Do exercises on the water cycle and start linking to the next sessions
- Quiz theme: general knowledge on the water cycle in various parts of the world

<!-- ELI

This session will focus on green SW infrastructure and their non-physical design constraints.
Those include cost and maintenance issues, social acceptance, multifunctionality (depollution, recreation, agriculture).
What are the responsibilities of decision makers regarding the design of such infrastructure?
Which official design guidelines exist and why do they matter?

- Quiz: discuss paper "Stormwater management and urban planning:Lessons from 40 years of innovation"
- Lecture topics:
National guidelines in development
Maintenance aspects
Social acceptance (recreational use, ready to do some maintenance?, understanding of the risks)
Relation between private developers, private design firms and municipalities (do all waters assets typically get vested to council in Norway?)
Do the municipalities have specific requirements for new developments? If not, what should they do and how?
Constructive critiscm on the blue/green factor method could be used as an exercise.
- Exercises or maybe project presentation / discussion as this session might come early in the course

<h2>Designing resilient SW infrastructure</h2>
<p><img src="images/PPT_Body.PNG" class="cover"> <a href="04_Urban_SW/3_design.html">Lecture</a></p>
<p>We will focus on specific green SW infrastructures. How do they work? How to size them according to our hydrological and hydraulics knowledge? Finally we will discuss practicallity, multi-functionnality and esthetics in design.</p>
<!--
Quiz / exercises on design calculations / drawings (redesign the campus?)
Or ask everyone to come with 1 example of good and bad design on the campus (or in Sogndal). Could be water-related but also other.
The example of bad design should come with a suggested better option.
- Brainstorming:
Ask students to brainstorm their ideas on good design principles for resilient SW infrastructure / water resources management
- Lecture linking all previous elements: hydrology, hydraulics, non-technical constraints.
- Design exercises
