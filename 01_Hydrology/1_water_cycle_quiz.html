<h2>Trond</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How long is the river Glomma?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">621km</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How many kilometers is Norway’s municipal pipeline for water?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Ca 46000km</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How many % of Norway is covered of freshwater?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">6%</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="jan" class="slide level2">
<h2>Jan</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the difference between arid and humid climate?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Arid: mean annual potential evaporation is higher than mean annual precipitation. Humid: mean annual potential evaporation is lower than mean annual precipitation</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the main features of continental and maritime climate regarding temperature?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Continental climate: hot summers, cold winters Maritime climate: cooler summers, warmer winters</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="christian" class="slide level2">
<h2>Christian</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What_does_isothermal_mean</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">it_is_a_thermodynamic_phase_change_without_temperature_change</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Florian: you should have asked - what is an isothermal process? Your example is not the only one. Some gas compression processes can be isothermal.</strong></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="hakon" class="slide level2">
<h2>Håkon</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the term used to describe how easily water penetrates the ground?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Permeability<br />
</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Florian’s note: It is called the intrinsic permeability. It is 1 of 2 factors in hydraulic conductivity that describe the properties of the porous material (pore size). The other factor represents the fluid properties (elements of hydrology chap. 6)</strong></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="hakon-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Håkon</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is Transpiration?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Water moving from the ground through a plant to then be evaporated to the atmosphere<br />
</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the difference between a meandering stream and a braided stream?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Meandering stream moves like an S, moves with erosion of banks. Braided stream is a combination of many smaller streams crossing each other, often full of sediments, forming a “braid”</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="jostein" class="slide level2">
<h2>Jostein</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What was the daily average water flow (m3/s) in Sogndalselvi during the flood in October 2014? </strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">113,67 m3/s</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the volume of Jostedalsbreen?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">73 km3</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the volume of all glaciers in Norway?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">262 km3 (NVE 2015)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="simen" class="slide level2">
<h2>Simen</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the residence time of water in rivers and lakes?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">4 years</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Where does the peruvian government look to retain water supply during summer months as CC worsen?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The bofedales</li>
<li class="fragment next">**Florian’s note: <a href="https://shapeofthingstocome.org/2014/09/19/what-the-hell-is-a-bofedal/**" class="uri">https://shapeofthingstocome.org/2014/09/19/what-the-hell-is-a-bofedal/**</a></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="calum" class="slide level2">
<h2>Calum</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How has urban drainage management changed over time since 1960? (What is now thought of alongside just ‘flood mitigation’). </strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Instead of just focusing on flood mitiagtion, management of urban drainage systems now take into account; recreation + aesthetics of system/area, using stormwater as a resource, water quality, the ecology of water course that system drains into and flow regime restoration.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="calum-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Calum</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are some of the obstacles to the uptake of blue green solutions in storm water management? </strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Path dependency - it is easier to stick to what you know rather than risk a more difficult option. BG solutions can take up a lot of space - difficult to pursuade people to allow high value sites to be used for BG solutions. Funding difficulty - BG solutions cannot be funded through water tax. People scared about running costs and maintenance (especially here in Sogndal in winter climate). ETC ETC.</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Florian’s note:</strong> automatic connection of new houses to the piped network. Kristian mentioned it here (houses that are within reasonable distance to the network). This is highlighted as a policy problem in a UK report on flooding.</li>
