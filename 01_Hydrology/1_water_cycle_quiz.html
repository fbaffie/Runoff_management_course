<h2>Astrid Oetting</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Are absolute temperature extremes connected to the moisture of a soil? </strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Yes, the dependence is mostly linear. If the soil moisture is relatively low, the temperatures are relatively high, lower summer temperatures correlates with a high moisture of soil. Shifting in the moisture conditions (dry/wet) lead to a shift in the temperatures as well (up to 2 or 4°C). Therefore, wet conditions (before summer) lead to less hot days in summer. Very hot summers are connected to dry conditions (with a small amount of precipitation and therefore low soil moisture) in spring.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="astrid-oetting-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Astrid Oetting</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How can the soil moisture be measured (large scale) and what are the problems? </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">The soil moisture can be measured with remote sensing. The method measures the soil moisture in the topmost 2 cm. For evapotranspiration is mostly the moisture in the root zone important, which lies below the 2 cm. Therefore, a combination of remote sensing data and data about the soil moisture in the root zone is necessary to create a reliable model. Also, the variability in the water content of the soil in the topmost 2 cm is stronger than in the root zone, as a result of the ability to store water (larger water storage in the root zone).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="vibeke-bruvoll" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke Bruvoll</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What type of soil have most impact on changes in evaporative fraction, wet, transitional or dry and why ?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Soil in the transitional regime has most impact on changing in evaporate franction as evaporation in this case is limited by amount of soil moisture. Dry soil do not have much moist to evaporate in the first place. In wet soil areas, is the amount of evaporation energy limited, and the amount of energy used in soil moisture evaporation does not depend on amount of soil moisture. Hence small variations in soil moisture don’t effect the amount of energy used in this areas or the evaporation fraction.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="vibeke-bruvoll-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke Bruvoll</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Is the paradigm wetter region getting wetter and dry regions getting dryer valid ? Why, why not ?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">No its not valid as most of the data that was the base of this conclusion came from ocean data on evaporation and precipitation patterns over time. Newer studies based on land data does not support this paradigm and show the need for research in regional scale on land to understand differences in the drought pattern over time.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="eirin" class="slide level2">
<h2>Eirin</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is El Nino?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">a sea saw condition that hasspens in 3-7 years intervals as the ocean conditions change from one state to another (warmer–&gt;cooler). Trade winds weaken and ocean water moves towards the east. Results in warmer ocean temperatures in South America (where there is normally upwelling of cold water during dominating conditions), this leads to more moisture in the atmosphere and rising sea levels in the east (east coast of North + South America).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="eirin-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Eirin</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are five expectations/observations of a warming climate?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Decrease in: sea ice, glaciers, snow cover. Increase in: sea surface temp., ocean heat content, sea level, temp. over oceans, humidity, air temp. near surface, temp. over land.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why is sea level rising faster in some areas compared to others?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">This is due to the intensity of the ocean currents.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="adam-g-dog-gairns" class="slide level2">
<h2>Adam “G-Dog” Gairns</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why cant you use remote sensing in understanding the effects of evapotranspiration in soil moisture?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Remote sensing only takes into consideration the top 2cm of soil when you need to record the soil moisture in the root level depths</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why is the known ‘Paradigm’ of ‘wet gets wetter, and the dry gets drier’ is not correct?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The data used was of ocean temperatures which is not a direct link to changes happening on land.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="erik-frivik-presthaug" class="slide level2">
<h2>Erik Frivik Presthaug</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What was the take-home message about the well-established paradigm of “Dry gets drier, Wet gets wetter”?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">This paradigm is not that definitive for land areas (according to study, only true for a minority of the regions (less than half)) but more so for ocean areas. However, the paradigm holds for the global perspective (global = ocean + land) but then not so much for land.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="erik-frivik-presthaug-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Erik Frivik Presthaug</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What effect does post-harvest tilling of farm land have on warm extremes (“heat waves”) and why is this effect claimed to be stronger in a future climate?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">It was shown that when farm land is tilled after harvest, it reduces the albedo of the area therefore absorbing more heat. Future climate will be hotter, providing less cloud cover, meaning more radiation to surface and more heat absorption (albedo becomes even more significant). Heat wave impacts could therefore be attenuated by crop residue management (no-till farming).</li>

<h2>Ragnar Grinde</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which two factors combined lead to a high frequency of abnormally hot summer days?&gt; -</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">A dry winter/spring followed by anticyclonic summer weather regimes (calm, fine weather with many sunny days) strongly increased the frequency of abnormally hot days.</li>

<h2>Helge</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Potential evaporation is a function of four drivers; What are the four drivers and what feedback-mechanisms from the land surface are these affected by?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Temperature, radiation, wind speed and relative humidity. These potential drivers are also affected by feedback from the land surface:</li>
<li class="fragment next">More evaporation will increase relative humidity</li>
<li class="fragment next">Wind speed is changing due to climate change</li>
<li class="fragment next">Radiation is changing due to increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also aerosol concentration is changing. In addition, precipitation can also be affected by land-atmosphere feedback.</li>

<h2>Famke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What kinds of droughts exist and what are they relating to?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Meteorological drought, which is related to a lack of precipitation</li>
<li class="fragment next">Soil moisture drought, which is related to a lack of moisture in the soil</li>
<li class="fragment next">Hydrological drought, which is related to a lack of stream flow - for observing droughts you need to take 2 parameters into account: evapotranspiration and potential evaporation</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="famke-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Famke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What effect has the albedo on the climate?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Change in albedo leads to cooling of hot extremes, caused by less cloud cover and therefore more radiation, which means that the change in reflectivity is more efficient at cooling the surface. A higher albedo also leads to less drying because of less warming</li>
<li class="fragment next">feedback loops: 1. Impact of albedo on temperature and 2. Delayed effect on soil moisture feedbacks</li>

<h2>Tonje Karin Rio</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Global mean temperature-rise has slowed down from 1998, but how have the temperature-rise evolved on land - compared to globally (land+ocean)?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">There has been a stronger increase on land than globally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why is the temperature-rise stronger on land?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Because heat has been taken up by the ocean. The land surface heat up more quickly, while the ocean has higher heat uptake (higher heat capacity).</li>

<li class="fragment next"><strong>Prof. Semeviratne argues that there will be an increased albedo effect in Europe and North America in the future, why is that?</strong></li>

<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Global mean temperature shows less of an increase in the period 2000-2014. At the same time, there is a clear increase in number of extremely hot days on land. How can this be?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The reason for the difference between the mean temperature and data on land is that the oceans have an enormous capacity to act as a buffer for increased temperature. On land the response is much faster and more dependent on local features. The proposed theory is that number of days with extreme temperature increases is connected to drought. After a drought, the moisture available for latent heat flux is less. This heat flux would normally result in a cooling effect where the phase shift occurs.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="kristine-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<p>This effect on soil moisture on extreme temperature events has been analyzed for different regions and globally, and there seems to be a positive correlation with less precipitation the previous 3 months and more temperature extremes. Allthough this is not the only factor that is controlling the temperature extremes.</p>
</section><section id="kristine-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Prof. Seneviratne talks of drought not only as a lack of precipitation. How does she define drought, and is it possible to find any global trends?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Types of drought are meteorological drought (lack of precipitation), soil-moisture drought (lack of water in the soil) and hydrological drought (no water in streams and extremely deep groundwater table). The drivers of a drought event is temperature, radiation, wind speed and relative humidity. Temperature and humidity are affected by how much evapotranspiration that takes place and are therefore affected by the land cover. The potential for evapotransipration will again depend on plant types, growing-cycle of the plants (eg. summer/winter) etc.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="kristine-3" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<p>Temperature, radiation and wind speed are all seen to be affected by climate change and it is clear that future projections for drought are extremely complex – this is clear when we look at the large uncertainty in the precipitation datasets for the last 60 years. Several methods and datasets also exist for evapotranspiration and these datasets show up till 30% difference.</p>
</section><section id="kristine-4" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<p>In a study from 2014 (Greve et al.) all these datasets were analysed to find the most robust trend. From this analysis one could find some regions where the change was robust when comparing two 20-year time-periods. So in most areas of the world the data available do not show a trend in drought. This analysis find that there are only a minority of regions that show a strengthening of existing regime -“dry gets drier and wet gets wetter”. This statement seems to be more relevant to oceans.</p>
