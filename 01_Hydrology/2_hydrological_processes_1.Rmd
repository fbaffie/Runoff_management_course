# Precipitation

## Strong non uniformity

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
<img src="images/condensation.jpg" class="one-col-image">
</p><p class="double-flow">
- Lapse rate with altitude
- Rain shadow effect
- Convective storms
- Showery weather
</p>
</div>

## Measuring precipitation
- Hyetograph represents: rainfall intensity as a function of time
- Rain gauges: tend to underestimate, only point measure
- Weather radars: variability shown, but less precise for specific locations


# Snow

## Snow distribution
> - **Which factors affect the spatial distribution of snow?**
> - <img src="images/RECAP_snow_distrib.png" height="auto" width="900">

## Snow and water resources

> - **How does snow affect the water cycle?**
> - Storage effect creates highly seasonal hydrological regime
> - Long infiltration event during snowmelt. 
> - Can be the main aquifer recharge event for some catchments (arid mountains)

> - **How do you link snow depth to the "Snow Water Equivalent" (SWE) of the snowpack?**
> - density relative to water (< 1) * height (m) = SWE in m
> - density (kg/m3) * height (m) = SWE in kg/m2 
> - SWE in kg/m2 = SWE in liters of water / m2 = SWE in mm/m2 

## Snow and forest
> - **What is the impact of forest on snow?**
> - Interception leads to increased sublimation
> - Interception leads to threshold effects and time lags in snow depth
> - Wind break effect leads to accumulation on one side
> - Less radiative cooling can increase melt rates at night
> - High albedo when snow has dropped

## Snow and climate
> - **How do glaciers affect the enery-balance downstream? Why does this phenomena happen?**
> - Katabatic wind
> - Radiative cooling of air on the glacier, which is heavier and drops down the valley

> - **How can a reduced snow covered area impact the climate?**
> - negative albedo feedback: more heating

## Snow and climate
> - **What are expected effects of climate change on the contribution of snow to river discharge regimes?**
> - The whole hydrograph shifts to earlier in the year 
> - Earlier peak discharge
> - Lower flows in late summer

## Meltwater infiltration through the snowpack
<img src="images/infiltration_through_snow.png" height="500" width="auto">

## Snowmelt
> - **When does snowmelt, as contribution of melting snow to the hydrological cycle, actually start?**
> -  when the snowpack become isothermal: the whole snowpack has some liquid water content and water can start infiltrating into the soil or running of it's surface
> - **If the snowpack is deep enough, it doesn't start on the first day of positive temperature. Why?**
> - The snowpack takes time to warm. Liquid water takes time to infiltrate through the snowpack and reach its base

## [Snowpack model](https://models.slf.ch/docserver/snowpack/html/general.html) and melt

<img src="images/snowpack_model.jpg" height="500" width="auto">

## Melt rate

> - **What was the peak snow water equivalent assuming 150cm of snow at a density of 0.33?**
> - 500mm
> - **It took about 50 days to melt. What's the average melt rate?**
> - 10mm/day

## Snowmelt models

Conceptual approaches:

- $M = C*(T-T_0)$ with C calibrated melt factor and $T_0$ calibrated temperature threshold
- $M = (C_1+C_2*u)*(T-T_0)$ with $u$ wind speed
- $M = (C_1+C_2*I)*(T-T_0)$ with $I$ solar short wave radiation
- $M = C_1*(T-T_0)+C_2*I*(1-\alpha))$ with $\alpha$ snow albedo

Other option: energy balance model

# Vegetation

## Vegetation's impact on hydrological response 

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
- Transpiration
- Storage of water
- Higher infiltration in the root zone
- Interception

## Evapotranspiration
> - **What is the difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration?**
> - Potential evapotranspiration only depends on energy input. It is the ET when the soil is wet
> - Actual evapotranspiration is limited by soil moisture and can be much smaller
> - Typical monthly values: 
http://www.waterandclimatechange.eu/evaporation/average-monthly-1985-1999

> - **How can you reduce evaporation from bare soil?**
> - Cover it
> - Create a wind break

## Penman-Montieth's equation

\[ET=\frac{\Delta (R_n-G) + \rho_a c_p \left( \delta e \right) g_a }{ \left( \Delta + \gamma \left ( 1 + g_a / g_s \right) \right) L_v }\]

with $ET$ the volume flux rate of ET (in mm/s)

$L_v = 2453 \ MJ. m^−3$ volumetric latent heat of vaporization

$\Delta$ Rate of change of saturation specific humidity with air temperature. (Pa K−1)

## Penman-Montieth's equation
$R_n$ Net irradiance (W m−2), the external source of energy flux

$G$ Ground heat flux (W m−2), usually difficult to measure

$c_p$ Specific heat capacity of air (J kg−1 K−1)

$\rho_a$ dry air density (kg m−3)

$\delta e$ vapor pressure deficit, or specific humidity (Pa)

$g_a$ Conductivity of air, atmospheric conductance (m s−1)

$g_s$ Conductivity of stoma, surface conductance (m s−1)

$\gamma = 66 \ Pa.K^-1$ Psychrometric constant

Written with energy flux rate
\[\lambda_v E = \frac{\Delta (R_n-G) + \rho_a c_p \left( \delta e \right) g_a }{\Delta + \gamma \left ( 1 + g_a / g_s \right)}\]

## Interception losses
> - **Interception losses are due to**
> - **a**: evaporation
> - **b**: transpiration
> - **c**: streamflow
> - **d**: none of the above
> - Answer: **a**

## How can those properties be useful with regards to green SW infrastructure?

> - Interception provides storage and mitigates the effect of heavy precipitation
> - Enhanced root zone infiltration
> - Evapotranspiration helps drying saturated ground after a heavy rain event

## Other advantages of trees in urban areas?

> - Shading limits heat island effect due to dark urban surfaces. Evapotranspiration too
> - Evergreen trees can have a warming effect in winter
> - Windbreak, air purification?
> - Beautiful, can have edible by-products!

## What are key problems with trees

> - They like water pipes
> - Branches can break on large less managed trees
> - Leaves litter need to be taken care of with deciduous trees

## Take home messages
- Hyetograph: precipitation intensity versus time
- Precipitation is non uniform. Radar measurements can help when station density is low.
- Interception: temporary storage of precipication by vegetation
- Evapotranspiration (ET): sum of all vaporization processes in a catchment (open water, soils, transpiration from plants)
- Actual ET in a catchment can be estimated by closing the hydrological cycle
- Potential ET: only depends on energy input. It is the ET if the soil is wet
- Actual ET <= Potential ET. Substantial difference in moisture limited catchments
- Snow storage measured in SWE: Snow Water Equivalent
- Snowmelt models either energy-balance or degree day approach
