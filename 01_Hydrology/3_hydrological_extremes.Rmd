# Flood risk

## Types of flood
> - **flash floods:** rapid, localized, associated with intense precipitation
> - **coastal floods:** sea level rise from tsunamis or storm surges
> - **urban floods:** flooding resulting from urbanization, usually linked to intense rather than sustained precipitation
> - **fluvial floods:** rivers rise out of the banks, due to sustained intense rainfall (catchment-scale)
> - **ponding (pluvial flood):** local ponding due to rainfall intensity exceeding infiltration
> - **groundwater rise (very local):** flood of cellars and other low areas due to extraordinary shallow water table

## Defining flooding risk

<img src="images/flooding_risk.png" height="500" width="auto">

## Flood zoning and risk assessment

- Get flood return levels (design flood) for an area (or model discharge from extreme precipitation)
- Use a hydraulic model to understand how high the water level will come ([HEC-RAS](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/) for example)
- Intersecting those water levels with the topography gives flood zone maps(see [NVE map catalog](http://gis3.nve.no/kartkatalog/metadatahg_datasett.html))
- Do a risk and vulnerability assessment (ROS: risiko og sårbarheitsanalyse) of the infrastructure in the flood zones
- Decide on protection measures, change the land use plan, or implement warning systems

## Design flood estimation methods

# Key probability concepts

## Vocabulary
> - **Annual exceedance probability**
> - Probability ($p$) that a flood will be equal or greater than a specific flood discharge called return level (or design flood).
> - **Return period (also called return interval)?**
> - The recurrence period ($T$) of a flood event equal or greater than the corresponding return level ($Q_T$)
> - Also means: the average time until the next occurrence of an event equal or greater than $Q_T$ is $T$ years
> - **What is the relationship between the probability $p$ and the return period $T$?**
> - $T = 1/p$

## [Flood probability exercises - see link](http://www.sciencecourseware.com/VirtualRiver/FloodingDemo/Files/page01a.html)
<!--
http://www.sciencecourseware.com/VirtualRiver/FloodingDemo/Files/page13.html
-->
> - **What is the probability of a 100-year flood happening in any given year?**
> - 1/100 = 0.01
> - **Can a 100-year flood happen 2 years in a row?**
> - Yes
> - **What would be the probability of this happening?**
> - $0.01*0.01 = 0.0001$

## Flood probability exercises
<img src="images/pdf.jpg" height="200" width="auto">

> - **Probability of a 100-year flood not happening in 100 years?**
> - $(1-0.01)^{100} = 36.6\%$
> - Of course, if the expected floods don't happen anymore, the flood should maybe be re-estimated.
> - **What is the probability of having a 25-year flood in a 10 year period?**


## Last question in steps
> - **What's the probability of a 25-year flooding event occurring each year?**
> - $1/25 = 4\%$
> - **What is the probability that a 25-year flood will not occurr in any given year?**
> - $1 - 1/25 = 96\%$
> -	**What's the probability that there will not be a 25-year flood in a 10 year period?**	 
> - $0.96^{10} = 66.5\%$
> -	**What's the probability that there will be a 25-year flood with a 10 year period?**
> - $100 - 66.5 = 33.5\%$

## Probability distribution functions (pdf) 
<img src="images/pdf.jpg" height="200" width="auto">

> - **Why does the mean annual flood correspond to a return period of 2.3 years?**
> - The Gumbel probability distribution is designed so that the average flood (arithmetic mean of all floods in the record) has a theoretical return period of 2.33 years.
> - **On the other hand, the median flood corresponds to a return period of ...?**
> - 2 years, because the median corresponds to a 50% probability of occurence

## Probability distributions
> - **mode, mean and median?**

## Probability distributions moments
> - **Name the first 3 moments (0th, first and second) of a probability distribution**
> - Mean, variance, skewness
> - **Draw the impacts of an increase in mean of hydrological extremes**
> - **Draw the impacts of an increase in variance of hydrological extremes**

## Analogy between moments of a pdf and mechanics
> - **Analog of the mean?**
> - Center of mass
> - **Analog of variance?**
> - Moment of inertia (also know as angular mass or rotational area)
> - **The $0^{th}$ moment is mechanics is the weight. What is it for a pdf?**
> - 1: the integral of the pdf is equal to a 100% probability!

<!--
## Analogy in formulas

> - **Variance (squared standard deviation)**
> - $Var(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i * (x_i-\mu)^2}$ with $\mu = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i*x_i}$
> - **Moment of inertia?**
> - $I = \int_{Q}{r^{2}\mathrm {d} m}$

## Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curve

Important concept to size stormwater infrastructure in small urban catchments

> - **Does a 100-year storm always cause a 100-year flood?**
> - No, there are different types of 100-year precipitation events and there are other important factors such as pre-storm ground condition, timing and spatial variability of the storm...

## Take home messages
- Extreme values derived for both river discharge and precipitation (IDF curves)
- Annual exceedance probability is the probability $p$ that a flood will be **equal or greater** than a specific return level $Q_T$ (for the return period $T=1/p$)
- Flood frequency analysis: various statistical methods based on fitting probability distributions to historical data
- Most methods used (so far in most countries) assume stationarity
- Extremes discharge values can be hydrological modelling results of applying extreme precipitation to specific catchments

On non stationarity in flood frequency analysis:
- Changes in the last 30/40 years are the effect of urbanization not climate change
- Be careful in assessing the cause of a non stationarity
