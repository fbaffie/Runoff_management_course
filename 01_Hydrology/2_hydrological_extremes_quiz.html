<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which 6 areas have been identified in this study as having improvment posibilities?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">More, and more accurate, monitoring data on long-term timeframes as floods are rare events and much data is needed to explain causal realtionships between CBFM/NFM and downstream effects.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Need more investigations on the scale dependencies of a model. Are models of small catchment areas valid on larger ones?</li>
<li class="fragment next">Need better coordination and collaboration of local and national flood risk management initiatives to fully understand the change in risk after mitigation. Which initiative gave most/ least effect?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="kristine-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">More systematic long-term data on the impacts on CBFM/NFM compared to traditional engineering solutions.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Toolbox with practical advice and updated research results for practitioners.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Improved communication between all involved stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Are there scientific knowledge to say that it is possible to mitigate extremely large floods?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">No. This does not mean that it is not possible, but might be because we have not implemented a large enough set of interventions to see an effect yet.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="tonje" class="slide level2">
<h2>Tonje</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What does the letters CBFM stand for, and can you explain what it is?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Catchment Based Flood Management.</li>
<li class="fragment next">«Catchment based flood management» includes interventions that seek to modify land-use, land management, river channels, floodplains and reservoirs, in order to reduce the frequency and severity of flooding. CBFM aims to reduce flood risk by looking at the wider catchment in stead of interventions locally at the point of flooding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tonje</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What does the letters NFM stand for, and can you explain what it is?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Natural Flood Management</li>
<li class="fragment next">«Natural flood management» is one subset of CBFM, which seeks to restore catchment and river processes that have been affected by human intervention.These activities may help reduce flood hazard, as well as enhancing co-benefits such as ecosystem services, greater biodiversity, improved soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion, greater agricultural productivity and improved public health.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="vibeke" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Name two important factors to understand the flood potential in channels?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Sediment transport and hydrology. All changes in channel cross-section could shift the sediment load in the river and create new depositional centers or areas with increased erosion. Reducing flood-plain availability would have impact on the floods that would normally use the floodplain as storage and flood level/ velocity dampener. Changes in the gradient of the river would lead to increased/decreased flowrate and change in erosional potential/ depositional patterns. These factors could lead to a shift in which areas that get flooded and the magnitude of the peak.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="vibeke-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is CBFM? and why is it so difficult to measure the impact?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Catchment Based Flood Management look at the catcment area in a holistic way and try to mitigate flood risks downstream by doing interventions at different levels in the catchment (and not only locally where the flooding creates a problem for human settlements/ land use etc). If the interventions are done by restoring natural processes adversly affected by humans, it is called Natural Flood Management. The magnitude of a fluvial flood depends on where you are in the catchment. The first step in a flood process is the inflow of water from hillslopes to a river. Next it is the merging of several rivers into one, and last, the merging of different cathments.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="vibeke-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Therefore- to understand the impact of a CFBM/NFM intervention it is crucial to take into account where in this system the intervention is done. This scale dependencie is also an important reason why it can be very difficult to compare CFBM/NFM interventions between different areas.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="adam" class="slide level2">
<h2>Adam</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>In small and large catchment areas, the peak of the flood hydrograph is dominated by what?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Small - Surface run off, from heavy rainfalls, Large - the channel network</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the differences in the three engineered activities; floodplain enroachment, distributed small-scale catchment and large-scale controlled storage on the peak flood level against flood probability</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Flood plain enroachment - increases peak flood level at lower flood probability, small-scale, reduces the peak flood level at low probabilities and large scale shows large reduction in peak floods with increasing probability</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="ragnar" class="slide level2">
<h2>Ragnar</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What does CBFM and NFM stand for, and what is the difference between them?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">CBFM stands for Catchment-Based Flood Management and refers to management interventions that seek to modify land-use and land management, river channels, floodplains and reservoirs in order to reduce the frequency and severity of flooding. NFM stands for Natural Flood Management and is a subset of CBFM. It focuses on either restoring or enhancing a natural catchment process that has been affected by human intervention.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="ragnar-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Ragnar</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Since the late 1990s the UK has been in a flood-rich period. Are today’s floods worse overall than flood records from the past 200 years?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Climate data point towards varying periods of flood-rich and flood-poor periods. Sedimentary deposits in small catchments also provide evidence for a similarly flood rich period to today, between 1840 and 1890. Data further shows that the seventeenth to nineteenth century UK experienced floods that were more frequent and more severe than those experienced since 1998</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="anne" class="slide level2">
<h2>Anne</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Several studies have investigated the potential effect of CBFM and NFM on flooding. Why do you have to be careful when interpreting the evidence?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Because each flood is a consequence of a unique combination of conditions.</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why does urbanization tend to increase peak flood flows? And when does urban flooding happen most often?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Increase peak flood flow because of reduces infiltration under paved areas and rapid flow over the surface, along channelized streams and through culverts and pipes. Urban flooding is generally greatest form intense storms in summer.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="astrid" class="slide level2">
<h2>Astrid</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What does CBFM and NFM stand for and what are their goals?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">CBFM and NFM stand for “Catchment-Based Flood Management” and “Natural Flood Management”. The goal of the CBFM is to reduce the frequency and strength of flooding. The NFM is a subset of the CBFM and aspires to restore/enhance catchment processes, which have been affected by human activity, to reduce flood hazards.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="astrid-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Astrid</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What other benefits occur with Flood Management?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Other benefits of the modification of land-use and land management, river channels, floodplains and reservoirs are enhanced ecosystem services (aquatic, riparian and terrestrial) with greater biodiversity, improved soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion, greater agricultural productivity and improved public health and well-being.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="sushmitha" class="slide level2">
<h2>Sushmitha</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How are the fluvial floods characterized?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The fluvial (river) floods hazard is characterized by the depth of water at locations where it may cause harm, and also by the velocity of that water, the rate of rise of water levels, duration of inundation and water quality.</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is CBFM all about?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Catchment-Based Flood Management(CBFM) is a management interventions that seek to modify land-use and land management, river channels, floodplains and reservoirs, in order to reduce the frequency and severity of flooding. One subset of CBFM is ‘Natural Flood Management’ (NFM), which seeks to restore or enhance catchment processes that have been affected by human intervention</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="sarina" class="slide level2">
<h2>Sarina</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What does the magnitude of a fluvial flood depend on?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The run-off from hillslopes into the river channel</li>
<li class="fragment next">The rate of propagation downstream into river channels</li>
<li class="fragment next">How the run-off multiple hillslopes and sub catchment areas (smaller rivers) combine via the channel network</li>
<li class="fragment next">Heavy rainfall</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which landcover is significantly related to flood magnitude?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Urban landcovers</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="theo" class="slide level2">
<h2>Theo</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the predictions, according to the models, about a systematic change in annual rainfall in the UK between now and 2080 (in terms of climate change)?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The projections show no significant change in annual rainfall. 80% of the simulations show between a 16% reduction and a 14% increase</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the influence of land cover on flooding?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">for small spatial scales is not enough evidence that the land cover influences floods, for land use impacts in larger catchments is not enough data. The only land cover factor that was significantly related to the magnitude of mean annual flood in UK rivers is urban extent. The effect of land cover changes on river flows in the Thames catchment is small compared with natural climatic variability.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="willemijn" class="slide level2">
<h2>Willemijn</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What’s the more important factor influencing extreme floods in large catchments: land-use or climatic variability?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Modelling of the Thames catchment shows that the effect of land cover changes on the river flow is small. The most important land cover change factor is urbanization, but the influence of natural climatic variability is larger.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What way can one restore historical data on climate variability and flood extent?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Using sedimentary deposits downstream, that provide an estimate of the sediment transported along the catchment, which is related to the amount (and velocity) of water in the stream.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="dag-petter" class="slide level2">
<h2>Dag Petter</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Catchment-Based Flood Management(CBFM) and Natural Flood Management (NFM) differs from traditional flood management techniques, how so?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Traditional flood management techniques focuses solely on flood mitigation, while CBFM/NFM incorporates potentially significant co-benefits such as enhanced eco-system services, greater biodiversity, improved soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion, greater agricultural productivity and improved health and well-being.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="dag-petter-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Dag Petter</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>The performance, longevity and operation and maintenance of CBFM/NFM can be difficult to assess due to uncertainties associated with the approach. This was discussed in the paper, (1) how do they recommend a CBFM/NFM system to be assessed, (2) why should they be monitored, and (3) are there anything to be cautious about?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">(1)Due to the complexity which is associated with co-benefits, they recommend to compare it to traditional engineering solutions. (2) This can uncover the degree of impact any specific setup in a catchment has. With proper monitoring, cause and effect of processes which are attempted can be lifted from a hypothetical concept to empirical knowledge. (3) All catchments are different, thus comparisons are not necessarily accurately depicting either catchment.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="helge" class="slide level2">
<h2>Helge</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Are there any trends in the flood patterns in the UK?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The UK has a long an dense precipitation dataset. The data show no change in average yearly precipitation, but it shows that there is a statisticial increase in winter precipitation, and a decrease in summer precipitation. The river with the longest flood gauge monitoring dataset (river Thames) show an increase in flood events, but no increase in flood magnitude. As measurement techniques has changed over the years, and many catchments have had flood managements interventions, it is difficult to find representative baseline data for most areas.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="helge-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Helge</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Analyzing sediment deposits it seems like there have been flood-rich periods (on decade-scales) followed by flood-poor periods. A limit with these analysis is that the sediment outpoor from the rivers could be affected by human interventions in the catchement area. Climate projections does not show any clear trend in annual precipitation patterns in the UK, but there could be local and temporal variations (enforcing the trends allready seen with more precipitation in winter).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="helge-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Helge</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>By changing land-use, is it possible to affect flood magnitudes?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Yes, for moderate rainfall events, but maybe not extreme events. This statement seems to be more valid for small/medium catchments and less for larger ones. Suggested actions:</li>
<li class="fragment next">Increase forest-cover</li>
<li class="fragment next">Secure appropriate forestry management - avoid clear-felling.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Maximize urban retention capacity to reduce flood magnitude.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Minimize soil compaction due to livestoock or machinery</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="john-sverre" class="slide level2">
<h2>John Sverre</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Name two examples on how we can manage infiltration and overland flow in urban land-use.</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Increase permeable areas and surface storage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What do projections on climate change show for annual rainfall totals in the UK</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">No systematic change (between a 16% reduction and a 14% increase, according to 80% of the simulations). However, there has been statistically significant changes in seasonal variation (increase in winter, decrease in summer).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="torbjrn" class="slide level2">
<h2>Torbjørn</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What does the term “Natural Flood Management” refer to? </strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">It as collective term for methods of flood management that seeks to restore or enhance catchment processes that have been affected by humans in one way or the other. These methods are characterized by having significant co-benefits such as improving or restoring ecosystem services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the most important, and in some studies the only, land cover factor that has an effect on mean annual floods? </strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The extent of urban land cover</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="torbjrn-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Torbjørn</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why should there be beavers in every stream?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Beavers rock. They build dams. Dams reduces the velocity and discharge in a stream.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="famke" class="slide level2">
<h2>Famke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which monitored catchment measures are important for flood mitigation?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Small and large catchment measures give a better understanding of the benefits of CBFM and NFM. The small catchments are used to simulate the changes of land use and management in larger catchments, whereas larger catchments establish scale and spartial location of different types of catchment based intervention that has an effect on flooding.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="famke-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Famke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the effects of forest on flooding?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Forests are in general expected to store more water in the soil, especially during summer, because of their greater usage of water compared to grasland. Forests produce higher evaporative losses, because of their storage of water in trees. If the flood is caused by storms (rarly happening) forests fuction as windblocker, so the flood is not huge. But if the flood is caused by other reasons there is almost no difference between forest and grasland.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="erik" class="slide level2">
<h2>Erik</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How can livestock farming influence flooding?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Livestock farming (in particular: high density) can lead to soil compaction, which in turn decreases infiltration capacity. According to a model study, this practice gave a 7 % increase in flood peak after a storm. In another study, a plot-scale experiment, grazed (by sheep) plots were compared to tree-planted plots and found to produce 48%-78% more run-off. After five years, infiltration rates were 67 times higher.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="erik-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Erik</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What other natural processes must one be mindful of when implementing interventions intended to reduce flooding (fluvial)?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">“Sedimentary, geomorphological and ecological processes in the river, as well as direct hydrological effects”.</li>
