<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How much water does a big birch tree “drink” during a hot summers day?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">circa 400 liters</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>In what ways can forest reduce flooding and the damages it prevents?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Keep the riverbed in place and shape. Prevent obsticales from creating further damage, filtering out rocks, debris and floating trees. Slowing down the water, reducing the energy in the flood. takes up water</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jan Zeiß</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How are Dolines created?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Dolines appear in karst aquifiers. Over time the water dissolves the limestone and creates cave systems. If the caves are close to the surface they can collapse, creating cone shaped depressions that are called Dolines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jan Zeiß</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the impacts of deforestation in Australia regarding groundwater and soil properties?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Deforestation causes higher evaporation rates. Consequently groundwater is not infiltrating the soil anymore but is moving upwards in the soil, transporting salt from the deeper layers to the top causing salinization of the soil.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Christian</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>what is the differrence between gaining streams and loosing streams?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">A gaining stream lies below the ground water table and is supplied from it and a loosing streams lies above the groundwater table and supplies the ground water</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which grain size has the highest porosity and has it also the highest permeability?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Clay has the highest porosity but the lowest permeability.</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the particularities of cloud forests in terms of hydrology?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Cloud forest in such high latitudes that they are almost permanently in the cloud layer and the trees gain much more water direct from the cloud and deliver it through into the soil than it would be delivered in that regions without the forests. Where those occur those are often the most important source of drinking water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Håkon the mad</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why is planet earths water an increasingly important topic for earths life?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Because, the availability and quality of clean water in many regions of the earth is threatened by overuse, misuse and pollution by humans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What are the pros and cons of a forest, compared to a plain, in relation to water supply?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Forest: Pro: Cleaner water, less erosion, less sediments, minerals, flood controll. Con: Allows less water to be supplied downstream; disrupts precipitation with canopy, evaporation from foliage, and transpiration. Plain: pro: Larger supply of water downstream, more flow above ground. Con: Dirtier water, more erosion, more sediments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Håkon the mad</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the goldilocks zone around the sun and why is it significant for life on earth?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The goldilocks zone is the distance to the sun which allows water to be present in all three states, as ice, liquid and gas. Earth is within this zone, and all life and climate on earth has based itself on water, powered by the sun. Water is like the blood flowing through the muscles and tissues of life, held by the skeleton earth, fed by the sun.</li>

<h2>Victoria</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Describe the difference between actual and potential evapotranspiration, and explain the importance in crop production.</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Potential evapotranspiration (PE) is a measure of the ability of the atmosphere to remove water from the surface through the processes of evaporation and transpiration assuming NO control on water supply. PE requires energy. The main source of energy is from the sun, and accounts for 80% of the variation in potential evapotranspiration in a given area. Wind is the second main source of energy. The rate of evapotranspiration is controlled by vapour pressure gradients set up between the surface where water is lost (e.g. stomata, leaf surface, ground surface) and humidity of the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Victoria</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Actual evapotranspiration is the actual amount of water that is removed from a surface due to the processes of evaporation and transpiration.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Crops are grown in areas without sufficient water supply for crop growth, hence management schemes are designed such as irrigation schemes. Irrigation schemes provide necessary supplementary water and is calculated by</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Crop water need to achieve maximum growth productivity?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">crop water need = potential evapotranspiration - actual evapotranspiration</li>

<h2>Oliver</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the main reason trees can use more water than shorter vegetation types?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Mainly due to the interception of rainwater by their aerodynamically rougher canopies.</li>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which type of forest (coniferous or broadleaf) uses the most water, and why?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">They have almost equal transpiration, but the conifers have higher interception because they have their needles all year</li>
