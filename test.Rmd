## Excursions



<!-- 

TO CHECK / PROCESS
for laminar flow in open channels, Reynolds number is less than about 500.
So nearly all open channel flows are turbulent.
Check why the maximum velocity in a stream is slightly below the surface, friction with the air?)

The explanation of the GIS techniques to come up with the automatic flood maps is interesting but hard to follow. Good example if Norwegian English  

Find the green ampt infiltration formula as an exercise?

Good chapter on evaporation in elements of hydrology 

Copy exercises but do not put them on the internet 

Exercise session 2 or 3, flood routing and the propagation of floods through reservoirs

> - **From this graph, what can you tell about the relationship between electrical conductivity and streamflow?**
> - There is an inverse proportionality which seems to depend on the season and the discharge.
> - **From this graph, what can you tell about the relationship between stream stage and groundwater stage near and far from the stream?**
> - **Cite another example where such dynamics happen on a daily basis. (tip: this is linked to a another periodical natural phenomenon)**

## Initial data and modelling results
<img src="images/phd/Paper 4 - Figure 3.png" height="450" width="auto">

## Two component mixing model
> - **Write the water balance to express $Q(t)$, the total discharge at time t, as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, the groundwater exfiltration and $Q_{gl}(t)$, the glacier melt contribution (we neglect rain and evapotranspiration)**
> - $Q(t) = Q_{gw}(t) + Q_{gl}(t)$
> - **Write the solute mass balance to express $Q(t) EC(t)$ (the mass of solutes exiting the catchment per second) as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $Q_{gl}(t)$ as well as $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$, which are respectively the constant electrical conductivity values for groundwater and glacier melt. EC is a proxy for the concentration of solutes in water.**
> - $Q(t) * EC(t) = Q_{gw}(t)*EC_{gw} + Q_{gl}(t)*EC_{gl}$

## Total discharge as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$

> - **By substituting $Q_{gl}(t)$ in one of the previous equations, express $Q(t)$ as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $EC(t)$ and the constants $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$**
> - $Q(t) = \frac{Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw} - EC_{gl})}{EC(t) - EC_{gl}}$


## Modelled baseflow recession
<img src="images/phd/Paper 4 - Figure 2.png" height="450" width="auto">

<!--
> - $Q(t)=Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})/(EC(t)−EC_{gl})$
$Q(t) = \frac{(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})Q_{gw}(t)}{EC(t)−EC_{gl}}$

## GW exfiltration as a function of groundwater level
\[Q_{gw}(t) = V_{slow}(t)*T_{slow} + V_{fast}(t) T_{fast}\]
-->

<!--
## Recession discharge
\[Q_{recession}(t) = Q_{meas}(t_{end})*e^{\frac{t_{end} − t}{T_{slow}}}\]
-->

<!--
## Groundwater storage as a function of field GW measurements
\[L_{integral}(t) = L_{integral}(t − 1t) + P_n i+1 L_i(t)−L_i(t−1t) n \]
with $L_{integral}(t_{end}) = L_{residual}$


##  Total groundwater flow as a function of field GW measurements
\[Q_{gw}(t) = baseflow_{max} + A_{fast} × L_{integral}(t) × \Phi * T_{fast}\]


## Benchmark efficiency
\[E = 1 − P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{mod}(t))^2 P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{bench}(t))^2\]

## Verifying $A_{slow}$ with snowmelt recharge
\[V_{slow}(t) = V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t}) + (R(t) − \frac{V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t})}{T_{slow}})* \Delta{t}\]
-->

## Aquifer recharge with snowmelt

<img src="images/phd/Paper 4 - Figure 6.png" height="450" width="auto">

## Mass balance verification for the infiltration rate

> - **Write the infiltration rate as a function of the storage volume and the exfiltration rate $Q_{gw}$**
> - We neglect evapotranspiration and recharge from rain 
> - $Q_{inf}(t) = dV(t)dt + Q_{gw}(t)$

# Climate change PhD example

## Climate change impacts

> - **Remember what "downscaling" is?**
> - Downscaling adds small-scale details, like topography-induced variations, which are not seen on the GCMs larger grid
> - **Which parameters are affected?**
> - Air temperature
> - Precipitation
> - Relative humidity
> - Wind speed
> - Wind direction


<!--
> - **What is an ensemble forecast?**
> - A forecast using many different models

## [Sintef Review of SW management practices](https://www.sintefbok.no/book/index/1121/review_of_stormwater_management_practices)

Good report

Table 1 page 10, SW quality figures
page 12, cold climate specifics
Big focus on water quality up to p24
Then goes through various green infrastructure techniques


Table 7 page32, depollution figures for a wet pond in oslo

p37/38: Advantages and disadvantages of source control systems. Summary of all techniques

Then compares countries in their management (a bit anecdotal)

A description of norwegian methods is described in: [Åstebøl and Roseth, 2014 - Vannbeskyttelse i vegplanlegging og vegbygging](https://www.vegvesen.no/_attachment/1160093/binary/1086413?fast_title=Vannbeskyttelse+i+vegplanlegging+og+vegbygging)
Quite good document in Norwegian focusing on depollution aspects

Other presentation in Norwegian focusing on water quality (https://www.fylkesmannen.no/Documents/Dokument%20FMOA/Miljø%20og%20klima/Vann/Overvannseminar%202014/Veivann%20og%20forurensninger%20-%20Svein%20Ole%20Åstebøl,%20COWI.pdf)


Interesting to see a threshold for pollution control in Germany:
"Maintenance of the already existing treatment methods is considered as a main priority in Germany. The treatment of runoff from roads is considered a requirement when the Annual Daily Traffic (ADT) exceeds 15,000 vehicles/day. Based on the recipient, treatment of runoff from roads is still required when the ADT is in the range of 2,000 -15,000. If the ADT value is less than 2,000 treatment of the runoff is not considered
as mandatory."

Could be a good quiz document
