<!-- 

TO CHECK / PROCESS
for laminar flow in open channels, Reynolds number is less than about 500.
So nearly all open channel flows are turbulent.
Check why the maximum velocity in a stream is slightly below the surface, friction with the air?)

The explanation of the GIS techniques to come up with the automatic flood maps is interesting but hard to follow. Good example if Norwegian English  

Find the green ampt infiltration formula as an exercise?

Good chapter on evaporation in elements of hydrology 

Copy exercises but do not put them on the internet 

Exercise session 2 or 3, flood routing and the propagation of floods through reservoirs 

Page 148, hydrology in practice, flow from unconfined aquifer 

check  the wallingford procedure for design of stormwater infrastructure page 472 hydro in practice 

Calculate flow in pipe at surcharge 
hydrology in pratice p429 design flood estimation methodology

First quizz on climate impact on the hydrological cycle (video?)
book chapter? www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/.../Hydrological%20cycleSpringer.pdf
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/trenbert/trenberth.papers/

another option would be a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hic_vcuO5Jo

or a shorter section of this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RC-IrL5D0A&index=40&list=PLsnOsjFNnFqacBToigfx0YeDee7Tlqeli&t=0s


Second quizz on the UK restatement paper
Third quizz on NVE report on flood mapping
Fourth quizz on student projects

Student project: model the Sogndal catchment with HBV light first, and then other methods

> - **From this graph, what can you tell about the relationship between electrical conductivity and streamflow?**
> - There is an inverse proportionality which seems to depend on the season and the discharge.
> - **From this graph, what can you tell about the relationship between stream stage and groundwater stage near and far from the stream?**
> - **Cite another example where such dynamics happen on a daily basis. (tip: this is linked to a another periodical natural phenomenon)**

## Initial data and modelling results
<img src="images/phd/Paper 4 - Figure 3.png" height="450" width="auto">

## Two component mixing model
> - **Write the water balance to express $Q(t)$, the total discharge at time t, as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, the groundwater exfiltration and $Q_{gl}(t)$, the glacier melt contribution (we neglect rain and evapotranspiration)**
> - $Q(t) = Q_{gw}(t) + Q_{gl}(t)$
> - **Write the solute mass balance to express $Q(t) EC(t)$ (the mass of solutes exiting the catchment per second) as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $Q_{gl}(t)$ as well as $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$, which are respectively the constant electrical conductivity values for groundwater and glacier melt. EC is a proxy for the concentration of solutes in water.**
> - $Q(t) * EC(t) = Q_{gw}(t)*EC_{gw} + Q_{gl}(t)*EC_{gl}$

## Total discharge as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$

> - **By substituting $Q_{gl}(t)$ in one of the previous equations, express $Q(t)$ as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $EC(t)$ and the constants $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$**
> - $Q(t) = \frac{Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw} - EC_{gl})}{EC(t) - EC_{gl}}$


## Modelled baseflow recession

<!--
> - $Q(t)=Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})/(EC(t)−EC_{gl})$
$Q(t) = \frac{(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})Q_{gw}(t)}{EC(t)−EC_{gl}}$

## GW exfiltration as a function of groundwater level
\[Q_{gw}(t) = V_{slow}(t)*T_{slow} + V_{fast}(t) T_{fast}\]
-->

<!--
## Recession discharge
\[Q_{recession}(t) = Q_{meas}(t_{end})*e^{\frac{t_{end} − t}{T_{slow}}}\]
-->

<!--
## Groundwater storage as a function of field GW measurements
\[L_{integral}(t) = L_{integral}(t − 1t) + P_n i+1 L_i(t)−L_i(t−1t) n \]
with $L_{integral}(t_{end}) = L_{residual}$


##  Total groundwater flow as a function of field GW measurements
\[Q_{gw}(t) = baseflow_{max} + A_{fast} × L_{integral}(t) × \Phi * T_{fast}\]


## Benchmark efficiency
\[E = 1 − P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{mod}(t))^2 P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{bench}(t))^2\]

## Verifying $A_{slow}$ with snowmelt recharge
\[V_{slow}(t) = V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t}) + (R(t) − \frac{V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t})}{T_{slow}})* \Delta{t}\]
-->

## Aquifer recharge with snowmelt

<img src="images/phd/Paper 4 - Figure 6.png" height="450" width="auto">

## Mass balance verification for the infiltration rate

> - **Write the infiltration rate as a function of the storage volume and the exfiltration rate $Q_{gw}$**
> - We neglect evapotranspiration and recharge from rain 
> - $Q_{inf}(t) = dV(t)dt + Q_{gw}(t)$

# Climate change PhD example

## Climate change impacts

> - **Remember what "downscaling" is?**
> - Downscaling adds small-scale details, like topography-induced variations, which are not seen on the GCMs larger grid
> - **Which parameters are affected?**
> - Air temperature
> - Precipitation
> - Relative humidity
> - Wind speed
> - Wind direction


<!--
> - **What is an ensemble forecast?**
> - A forecast using many different models
