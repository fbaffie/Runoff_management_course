Methodology of flood estimation

I probably should have a wider list of design flood estimation methods in the hydro_extremes lecture

## Initial data and modelling results

## Two component mixing model
> - **Write the water balance to express $Q(t)$, the total discharge at time t, as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, the groundwater exfiltration and $Q_{gl}(t)$, the glacier melt contribution (we neglect rain and evapotranspiration)**
> - $Q(t) = Q_{gw}(t) + Q_{gl}(t)$
> - **Write the solute mass balance to express $Q(t) EC(t)$ (the mass of solutes exiting the catchment per second) as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $Q_{gl}(t)$ as well as $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$, which are respectively the constant electrical conductivity values for groundwater and glacier melt. EC is a proxy for the concentration of solutes in water.**
> - $Q(t) * EC(t) = Q_{gw}(t)*EC_{gw} + Q_{gl}(t)*EC_{gl}$

## Total discharge as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$

> - **By substituting $Q_{gl}(t)$ in one of the previous equations, express $Q(t)$ as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $EC(t)$ and the constants $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$**
> - $Q(t) = \frac{Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw} - EC_{gl})}{EC(t) - EC_{gl}}$


## Modelled baseflow recession

<!--
> - $Q(t)=Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})/(EC(t)−EC_{gl})$
$Q(t) = \frac{(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})Q_{gw}(t)}{EC(t)−EC_{gl}}$

## GW exfiltration as a function of groundwater level
\[Q_{gw}(t) = V_{slow}(t)*T_{slow} + V_{fast}(t) T_{fast}\]
-->

<!--
## Recession discharge
\[Q_{recession}(t) = Q_{meas}(t_{end})*e^{\frac{t_{end} − t}{T_{slow}}}\]
-->

<!--
## Groundwater storage as a function of field GW measurements
\[L_{integral}(t) = L_{integral}(t − 1t) + P_n i+1 L_i(t)−L_i(t−1t) n \]
with $L_{integral}(t_{end}) = L_{residual}$


##  Total groundwater flow as a function of field GW measurements
\[Q_{gw}(t) = baseflow_{max} + A_{fast} × L_{integral}(t) × \Phi * T_{fast}\]


## Benchmark efficiency
\[E = 1 − P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{mod}(t))^2 P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{bench}(t))^2\]

## Verifying $A_{slow}$ with snowmelt recharge
\[V_{slow}(t) = V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t}) + (R(t) − \frac{V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t})}{T_{slow}})* \Delta{t}\]
-->

## Aquifer recharge with snowmelt

## Mass balance verification for the infiltration rate

> - **Write the infiltration rate as a function of the storage volume and the exfiltration rate $Q_{gw}$**
> - We neglect evapotranspiration and recharge from rain 
> - $Q_{inf}(t) = dV(t)dt + Q_{gw}(t)$

# Climate change PhD example

## Climate change impacts

> - **Remember what "downscaling" is?**
> - Downscaling adds small-scale details, like topography-induced variations, which are not seen on the GCMs larger grid
> - **Which parameters are affected?**
> - Air temperature
> - Precipitation
> - Relative humidity
> - Wind speed
> - Wind direction


<!--
> - **What is an ensemble forecast?**
> - A forecast using many different models
