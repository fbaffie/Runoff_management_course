## To check

Online course: [Introduction to critical zone science](https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/critical_zone/index.html)

For land use: Unit 7.2 - Agricultural Impacts
https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/critical_zone/humans_unit2.html

TO CHECK FOR POTENTIAL COMPLEMENT OF EXERCISES
Unit 7. Low Impact Development and Green Infrastructure
https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/water_cities/lesson7.html

TO CHECK FOR THE HYDRO CYCLE SESSION
Unit 1.2: Exploring the Hydrologic Cycle
https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/ecosystem_water/unit1.2.html

COULD BE USEFUL FOR FIRST EXERCISE SESSION
Unit 5.2 - Water Balance Impacts
https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/critical_zone/water_unit2.html

Unit 5.1 - Water Balance of a Tree
https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/critical_zone/water_unit1.html


Exercises on the rational method:

<!-- 
TO CHECK / PROCESS
for laminar flow in open channels, Reynolds number is less than about 500.
So nearly all open channel flows are turbulent.
Check why the maximum velocity in a stream is slightly below the surface, friction with the air?)

The explanation of the GIS techniques to come up with the automatic flood maps is interesting but hard to follow. Good example if Norwegian English  

Find the green ampt infiltration formula as an exercise?

Good chapter on evaporation in elements of hydrology 

Exercise session 2 or 3, flood routing and the propagation of floods through reservoirs 

Page 148, hydrology in practice, flow from unconfined aquifer 

check  the wallingford procedure for design of stormwater infrastructure page 472 hydro in practice 

Calculate flow in pipe at surcharge 

hydrology in pratice p429 design flood estimation methodology
