# SUGGESTED GROUP PROJECTS

<!-- ## Effect of green roofs: runoff and soil moisture -->

<!-- Green roofs: there is good pdf from NVE, soil moisture sensors good be installed in a roof. Maybe the roof of Sogndal hotel? -->

<!-- ## Intensity duration frequency curves  -->
<!-- Compute IVF curves for sogndal, selseng -->

##  Glacier lake outburst floods

Glacier lake outburst flood in Norway, with focus on a specific location, like harbardsbreen, breheimen, or Blaamannsisen, Nordland.
Look at NVE's modelling methodology. It could be applied to Blaamannsisen. Discuss other potential modelling and surveillance methods.

## Hydrological modelling in the Sogndal valley

Data exploration and hydrological modelling of the Sogndal catchment using R and/or HBV-light
This can also have an experimental aspect. Available equipment: portable EC/pH meter, soil moisture sensors, soil temperature sensors, water pressure sensors, fluorometer)
<!--
- Instrument the Sogndal stream close to the campus or lower towards the outlet, do fluorometer / salt experiments and try to understand: how much more flow is there here than at Sogndalsvatn, how much time does river routing take, is it dependent on discharge rate? discuss the limitations
-->

## Comparing discharge measurement techniques

You can use several methods and compare the results:

Salt dilution, dye tracer dilution, discharge app, portable flow meter.

This project would work well in copperation with the next project (floodrouting).


## Flood routing for Sogndalselvi

Experiment with this new [discharge app](https://discharge.ch/).
Explain how it works.
There is an automatic discharge station at the downstream end of Dalavatnet. Complement those data with measurements further down (or up) the valley to come up with a flood routing model for the Sogndal catchment. An interesting question can be understanding the effect of Sogndalsvatnet on flood damping.
This project can be linked to the hydrological modelling of the Sogndal catchment.

## Erosion experiment with soil moisture sensors

Using the plexiglas apparatus in the geolab
This could include piping experiments [Laboratory soil piping and internal erosion experiments](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.3508)

## Field hydrology and hydraulics in Olnes

The catchment above my place (Fjordhytter, Olnes) is hard to define. The flowpaths are also not straightforward.
Overflowing could erode the apple orchards. What are the current and future risks?
This project could involve field experiments such as flow measurements and dye tracing.
It could also involve scenarios of further residential development.

## Synthesis projects
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

- Recommendation for green infrastructure design in Norway: which techniques are promising, where, under which circumstances...
- Prepare a set of reference drawings / specifications on stormwater management for Western Norway?
- Develop a cheatsheet on green SW infrastructure (i.e [nervous system](https://www.cheatography.com/davidpol/cheat-sheets/sympathetic-nervous-systems/pdf/), [R programming](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf))

## Synthesis projects: expectations
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

- Explanation of choices
- Steal like an artist: build upon the resources synthesized
- Neat and practical final product

<!-- ## Building projects -->
<!-- <img src="images/logo.png" class="cover"> -->

<!-- - Design / Build a water pump or any other hydraulic  feature (i.e ram pump). 2000 Kr available.  -->

<!-- Expectations: similar to design projects + explain why it works as it does. -->

# Further development of last year's projects

## Design projects: Leikanger 100 dwellings, 10ha

## Design projects: options
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
Different design challenges:

- minimum extra outflow (least hydrological impact)
- off the grid design
- most agriculture / food production friendly design
- design (incl. climate change) for its actual climate or 
- semi-arid climate (US mid-west, middle east)
- mediteranean climate (Marseille, California)
- (sub)tropical climate (NSW, central America)

## Design projects: other ideas
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

- You can suggest another area to be developed
- Re-design the campus for water harvesting and irrigation of urban agriculture. This could be linked to smart reservoirs.
- Look for problems involving SW in the region and propose solutions (dirt roads, specific locations in Sogndal)

## Design projects: expectations
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

- Drawings (hand, sketchup...) are encouraged. 
- Try to specify construction requirements: inputs / outputs in materials, timing
- Explain the process: your assumptions, calculations, context, design choices...
- Be creative: do not give only 1 option
- No need for huge report

## Lab permeameter / Field infiltration experiments
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

Further experiment with the lab permeameter. 

Compare with simple field infiltration experiments

Soil moisture sensors can be used in field experiments.

Determine soil properties

## Further ideas

Smart water harvesting: empty tanks before significant rain

Crowd sourcing hydrological / infrastructural information


## Project groups + second project
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

People	| Main project	|  Second project
--- | --- | --- 
People | project |  project2

## Project development
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

- Groups and subjects (including second project) to be decided before Mai 9.
- Last quiz dedicated to projects. 4 Q/A on your project, 2 Q/A on the second project.
- During the 10 day period before the exam, you can come consult us.

## Project reporting and presentation
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

- The reports are sent to fkba@hvl.no and uploaded to fronter: Friday 9th of June. 24:00 
- Slide show of 5 minutes per person (so 15 or 20 min total depending on the group)
- Videos could be part of the reporting, but not only
- The group with the same "second project" as the presenters gets priority for questions. They should have read the "second project" report in detail.
- The individual exam will then discuss the personal project, the second project and the course material

## Overall assessment criteria

- How much work was put into it. Reasonably easy to see!
- Creativity: I do not want only a synthesis of existing documents.
- Rigor: discuss well the limitations of your approach
- Overall report quality and structure: what is the problem, why? How did we tackle it? What are our results and why are they good / bad?
- For experimental / modelling project: good explanation of the analysis (available data, methods, assumptions, results)
- Explain the why, what and how of experimental setup
- Present results in a critical way: what went well and what didn't
- Shy / less eloquent presenters will not be penalized. The whole group gets one common grade.
