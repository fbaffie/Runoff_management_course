<h2>Glacier lake outburst floods: case study on Harbardsbreen, Breheimen</h2>
<p>Two lakes form every year within central parts of Harbardsbreen. The larger one has produced several jøkulhlaups during the past 20 years (<a href="http://publikasjoner.nve.no/rapport/2014/rapport2014_83.pdf">NVE report: inventory of glacier-related hazardous events in Norway</a>).</p>
<p>The thickness of the ice dam was measured by ground-penetrating radar in the 1990s. Surface-elevation of the glacier has decreased during the past 50 years.</p>
</section><section id="glacier-lake-outburst-floods-case-study-on-harbardsbreen-breheimen-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Glacier lake outburst floods: case study on Harbardsbreen, Breheimen</h2>
<p>You will determine the critical water level in the lake at which the lake drains (lifting the glacier ice). Considering the areal extent and bottom topography of the lake, you will estimate the lake volume associated with critical water level.</p>
<p>You will outline the catchment from which the lake draws water from and estimate the time for the lake to fill, given snow water equivalent at the beginning of the summer melt period, rain and snow melt using meteorological data (senorge). Does the water input to the lake vary from year to year? Can the occurance of past jøkulhlaups be explained by certain meteorological and hydrological conditions?</p>
</section><section id="hydrological-modelling-in-the-sogndal-valley" class="slide level2">
<h2>Hydrological modelling in the Sogndal valley</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data exploration and hydrological modelling of the Sogndal catchment using R and/or HBV-light.</li>
<li>This can also have an experimental aspect. Available equipment: portable EC/pH meter, soil moisture sensors, soil temperature sensors, water pressure sensors, fluorometer) <!--
- Instrument the Sogndal stream close to the campus or lower towards the outlet, do fluorometer / salt experiments and try to understand: how much more flow is there here than at Sogndalsvatn, how much time does river routing take, is it dependent on discharge rate? discuss the limitations
--></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="comparing-discharge-measurement-techniques" class="slide level2">
<h2>Comparing discharge measurement techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can use several methods and compare the results: salt dilution, dye tracer dilution, discharge apps (discharge.ch and crowdwater.ch), portable flow meter.</li>
<li>This project would work well in copperation with the next project (flood routing).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="flood-routing-for-sogndalselvi" class="slide level2">
<h2>Flood routing for Sogndalselvi</h2>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with this new <a href="https://discharge.ch/">discharge app</a> or use results from the discharge gauging group.</li>
<li>There is an automatic discharge station at the downstream end of Dalavatnet. Complement those data with measurements further down (or up) the valley to come up with a flood routing model for the Sogndal catchment.</li>
<li>An interesting question can be understanding the effect of Sogndalsvatnet on flood damping.</li>
<li>This project can be linked to the hydrological modelling of the Sogndal catchment.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="erosion-experiment-with-soil-moisture-sensors" class="slide level2">
<h2>Erosion experiment with soil moisture sensors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using the plexiglas apparatus in the geolab</li>
<li>This could include piping experiments <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.3508">Laboratory soil piping and internal erosion experiments</a></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="synthesis-projects" class="slide level2">
<h2>Synthesis projects</h2>
<!-- <img src="images/logo.PNG" class="cover"> -->
<ul>
<li>Recommendation for green infrastructure design in Norway: which techniques are promising, where, under which circumstances…</li>
<li>Prepare a set of reference drawings / specifications on stormwater management for Western Norway?</li>
<li>Develop a cheatsheet on green SW infrastructure (i.e <a href="https://www.cheatography.com/davidpol/cheat-sheets/sympathetic-nervous-systems/pdf/">nervous system</a>, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf">R programming</a>)</li>

</section><section id="design-sw-infrastructure-in-3-steps" class="slide level2">
<h2>Design SW infrastructure in 3 steps</h2>
<p>Try different methodologies to come up with recommendations regarding the points Asplan Viak made at <a href="http://webfileservice.nve.no/API/PublishedFiles/Download/201707426/2327579">an NVE conference</a></p>
<p>Three steps for urban stormwater management were linked to different return periods:</p>
<p>Step 1 using the mean annual flood: local infiltration / retention Step 2 using a 20-year: flood: neighborhood-scale measures Step 3 using a 200-year flood: safe overflows.</p>
<p>How to design stormwater infrastructure according to those guidelines? Asplan Viak was putting forward volumes in percent of how each step is contributing to specific events. I suspect they are partly guessed. Could there be a reliable methodology?</p>
</section><section id="optimizing-hydropower-for-flood-protection" class="slide level2">
<h2>Optimizing hydropower for flood protection</h2>
<p>Can hydro-meteorological modelling and historical statistical analysis help to optimize the management of Leirdalvatnet in autumn.</p>
<p>The short residence time in the reservoir makes the task of optimizing flood protection versus maximizing earning potential difficult.</p>
<p>You could look at international examples of coupled hydropower and flood mitigation (i.e. Switzerland); and discuss ecological impacts vs human benefits.</p>
</section><section id="sites-vulnerable-to-future-changes-in-runoff" class="slide level2">
<h2>Sites vulnerable to future changes in runoff</h2>
<p>Example: field hydrology and hydraulics in Olnes</p>
<p>The catchment above my <a href="http://www.norgeskart.no/#!?project=seeiendom&amp;layers=1002,1015&amp;zoom=17&amp;lat=6817579.53&amp;lon=80011.2">place</a> (Fjordhytter, Ølnes) is hard to define. The flowpaths are also not straightforward.</p>
<p>Overflowing could erode the apple orchards. What are the current and future risks?</p>
<p>This project could involve field experiments such as flow measurements and dye tracing. It could also involve scenarios of further residential development.</p>
<!-- Map the stormwater network (involves some filedwork). Understand where critical points are and how they may lead to urban flooding. -->
</section><section id="further-ideas-you-could-explore" class="slide level2">
<h2>Further ideas you could explore</h2>

<li>Crowd sourcing hydrological / infrastructural information (see crowdwater.ch)</li>
