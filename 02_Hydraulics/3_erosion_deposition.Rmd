## [Pollution in sediments](http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2598E/w2598e05.htm)

> - Pollution by sediment has two main aspects:
> - Physical: top soil loss and land degradation leads to high turbidity and to later deposition in river and lake beds.
> - Chemical: the silt and clay fractions (<63m m fraction) are primary carriers of adsorbed chemicals, especially phosphorus, chlorinated pesticides and heavy metals
> - This is why sedimentations basins are often important for SW depollution
> - Of course a big part of the chemical pollution is also disolved


## Stokes sphere

</svg>

## Stokes Law
If we assume: laminar flow, spherical particles, homogeneous material, smooth surfaces and particles not interfering with each other.

The force of viscosity on a small sphere moving through a viscous fluid is given by:

\[F_d = 6 \pi \mu r v\]
where: $F_d$ is the frictional force, Stokes' drag
$\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity
$r$ is the radius of the spherical object
$v$ is the flow velocity relative to the object.

## Velocity of a sphere falling in a fluid

At terminal (or settling) velocity, the excess force $F_g$ due to the difference between the weight and buoyancy of the sphere is:

\[F_g = \left(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f}\right)\,g\,{\frac {4}{3}}\pi \,R^{3},\]

with $\rho_p$ and $\rho_f$ the mass densities of the sphere and fluid

$R$ the particle diameter

$g$ is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2)

## Velocity V (m/s) of a sphere falling in a fluid
$V={\frac {2}{9}}{\frac {\left(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f}\right)}{\mu }}g\,R^{2}$

$\rho _{p}$ is the mass density of the particles (kg/m3)

$\rho _{f}$ is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3)

$\mu = 10^{-3} Pa.s$ is the dynamic viscosity.

V > 0 when a particle is falling. 

V is proportional to $R^2$

## Settling velocities: you can compare with the theory

<!--
## Universal soil loss equation
$A=RKLSCP$ The USLE has another concept of experimental importance, the unit plot concept. The unit plot is defined as the standard plot condition to determine the soil's erodibility. These conditions are when the $LS$ factor = 1 (slope = 9% and length = 72.6 feet) where the plot is fallow and tillage is up and down slope and no conservation practices are applied (CP=1). In this state:

$K=A/R$ A simpler method to predict $K$ was presented by Wischmeier et al.[7] which includes the particle size of the soil, organic matter content, soil structure and profile permeability. The soil erodibility factor $K$ can be approximated from a nomograph if this information is known. The $LS$ factors can easily be determined from a slope effect chart by knowing the length and gradient of the slope. The cropping management factor ($C$) and conservation practices factor ($P$) are more difficult to obtain and must be determined empirically from plot data. They are described in soil loss ratios ($C$ or $P$ with / $C$ or $P$ without).

# Examples around Sogndal

## Internal erosion: Piping through dams

Water flow through soils can lead to (internal) soil erosion if quick enough.

It is a common cause of failure for earth dams and levees (dikes) as it is often detected too late. This is why they need to be regularly monitored.

It is one of the reasons for not planting vegetation on dikes

## What's the problem

## Bad erosion management on construction site

- Not a huge issue in the case
- It will just create them more work to come tidy it up

Fixes:

- Easing the slope of the fill above
- Having a flat terrasse between the fill and the next slope
- Installing erosion control materials

## What's the problem and why?
<img src="images/sogndal/signs_of_erosion.JPG" height="500" width="auto">

## Signs of erosion: already!

- The local biome is resilient (regular rainfall, not too many extremes)
- But clear-cutting steep slopes can still lead to erosion
- In dry mediteranean, this could be more dramatic

## Sedimentation analogy: [Why don't clouds fall?](http://lamp.tu-graz.ac.at/~hadley/whydontcloudsfall.html)

> - **Clouds can hold a lot of water so why don't they fall?** 
> - The small water droplets that make up clouds fall extremely slowly. The drag force of the air dominates over the gravitational force for small particles. The drag force increases as the size of an object decreases. Applying Stokes Law gives: $F = 6\pi\eta Rv$
> -$R$ is the radius of the sphere, $v$ is the velocity, and $\eta$ is the viscosity. The viscosity of air is about $0.018*10^-3 Pa.s$ and the viscosity of water is about $1.8*10^-3 Pa.s$. 
> - Stokes's law is valid if the Reynolds number $N_{reynolds} = 2R \rho v/\eta$ is less than about 2000. Here $\rho$ is the mass density.

## Why don't clouds fall?
> - A spherical particle falling under the force of gravity will reach terminal velocity when the gravitational force matches the drag force: $mg = 6\pi\eta Rv$
> - Solving this for the terminal velocity yields: $v_{terminal} = 2g\rho R^2/(9\eta)$
> - A water droplet with a 10 nm radius falls at 12 nm/s in air. It would take 2.6 years for this droplet to fall one meter. It is only when the small droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets that they fall with significant speed.

<!--
In some sense, the inverse effect to rain is the rising of bubbles in beer. Bubbles are lighter than the surrounding liquid so gravity pushes them up. They rise with a constant velocity which is described by Stokes law. If you are the type that carefully observes your beer, you will have noticed that sometimes the bubbles move down. This is because of the circulation of liquid in the beer glass. The rising bubbles in the center of the glass drag some liquid along with them. After this liquid reaches the top of the glass, it returns to the bottom along the sides of the glass. This downward flow can drag bubbles, especially small bubbles, downwards against the force of gravity.

In a similar manner, small rain drops can be pull up by air currents against the force of gravity."
