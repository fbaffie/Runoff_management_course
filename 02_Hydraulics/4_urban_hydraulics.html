## Vocabulary
> - **Rising limb** 
> - The rising limb of hydro graph, also known as concentration curve, reflects a prolonged increase in discharge from a catchment area, typically in response to a rainfall event
> - **Recession (or falling) limb** 
> - The recession limb extends from the peak flow rate onward. The end of stormflow (a.k.a. quickflow or direct runoff) and the return to groundwater-derived flow (base flow) is often taken as the point of inflection of the recession limb. The recession limb represents the withdrawal of water from the storage built up in the basin during the earlier phases of the hydrograph.

> - **Peak discharge**
> - The highest point on the hydro graph when the rate of discharge is greatest

## Vocabulary
> - **Lag time** 
> - The time interval from the center of mass of rainfall excess to the peak of the resulting hydrograph

> - **Time to peak** 
> - Time interval from the start of the resulting hydro graph

> - **Discharge** 
> - the rate of flow (volume per unit time) passing a specific location in a river or other channel

<li class="fragment next">Unit conversion: 100l/Ha of precipitation intensity is <span class="math inline">\(0.1m3/s\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(10000m^2\)</span> (1 Ha is 100*100m)</li>
<li class="fragment next">So for <span class="math inline">\(5m^2\)</span> of road <span class="math inline">\(Q = C*i*A = 0.9*0.5/10000 = 4.5*10^{-5} m3/s\)</span></li>
