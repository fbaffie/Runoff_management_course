## Air pressure and water pressure
> - **What is the pressure under a 10m water collumn?**
> - 1 bar = 100 kPa
> - **Why?**
> - 1 Pa is 1 N/m^2 which is equivalent to 0.1 kg/m^2 with g=10 m/s2
> - So 10^5 Pa is equivalent to 10 000 kg/m2
> - 1m water is 1000kg/m2
> - 10m water is 10 000kg/m2



## Total head:  elevation head + pressure head + velocity head

> - Elevation head: $z$
> - Pressure head: $\frac {p}{\rho g}$
> - Elevation head + pressure head = the piezometric head $h$ (static hydraulic head) that we used for Darcy's Law
> - **But we neglected the velocity head, because of slow velocities in porous media**
> - Velocity head:$\frac {v^{2}}{2g}$

## Bernouilli's equation

States that the total head $H$ is constant:

\[H = z+{\frac {p}{\rho g}}+{\frac {v^{2}}{2g}}= h + \frac {v^{2}}{2g} = constant\]
where $z$ is the elevation head and $h$ the piezometric head

Assumptions:

- no friction
- incompressible fluid
- steady flow
- homogeneous fluid

## Exercise: flow out of a reservoir

> - **An open top reservoir (atmospheric pressure) is pierced at $z_1$, d=20cm below the top water level $z_2$. Calculate the average flow velocity out of the hole.**
> - $z_1 + p_{atmo}/\rho g = v^2/(2g)+z_2+p_{atmo}/\rho g$
> - $v= (2gd)^{1/2} = (20*0.20)^{1/2} = 2m/s$  

## Pump example: the ram pump
> - **How would we design a pump that doesn't use any external energy (only gravity)?**
> - By using the momentum of falling water and wasting much water in the process: the ram pump
> - drive pipe brings intake water
> - delivery pipe is the pressurized pipe
> - check valve to stop pressurized pipe from emptying
> - waste valve to evacuate excess water and control the ram effect
> - air chamber to make the ram effect smoother to avoid damaging the pump

## Schematics of a ram pump

## Animation of a ramp pump
<img src="images/ram_pump.gif" height="500" width="auto">

## How much water can it pump
> - **Can you guess the likely formula to calculate this?**
> - $D = E*Q*F/L$
> - Where: $D$ amount delivered in cube meters per hour.
> - $Q$ quantity of water supplied from the source in cube meters per hour.
> - $F$ the fall or height of the source above the ram in meters.
> - $L$ the lift height of the point of use above the ram in meters
> - $E$ the efficiency of the ram (typically 60%)
> - **How does the efficiency likely vary as a function of the lift / working fall ratio**
> - The efficiency is likely to drop with high lift / working fall ratios due to more water wastage, higher velocities, turbulence...

## Other instances of water hammer
> - **Why can a water hammer be a problem with pumps and pipes?**
> - The ram effect can destroy valves or pipes by applying sudden high pressure

> - **How is that mitigated in pump pressurized networks?**
> - Pressure release chambers or pressure release valve

## Analogy with the cardio vascular system

> - **The cardio-vascular system also has a pulse pump. The flow in blood vessels is however more regular, like in the ram pump after the air chamber. Which mechanical property of the blood vessels plays an analog role as the air chamber?**
> - The elasticity of the arteries

## Micro-hydropower exercise

[NVE - småkraft potensial](https://gis3.nve.no/link/?link=smakraft): estimate the hydro-electric potential ("Produksjon") of some sites around Sogndal in GWh/year (using mean available discharge "Vannføring" and elevation difference "Brutto fallhøyde")

Compare to NVE's estimate: it looks like they included a 1.3 factor to account for climate change? In the field "effekt", it looks like they took efficiency into account. Why can I say that?

You can also look at the figures for the site in Berge: [Technical details](http://www.smaakraft.no/prosjekter-i-utvikling/berge/), [NVE's concession document](https://www.nve.no/konsesjonssaker/konsesjonssak/?id=4244&type=V-1)

# Flow with friction

## Shear forces and viscosity

<svg height="450" width="auto">
<image xlink:href="images/shear_stresses.svg" src="svg.png" min-width="100%" height="450"/>
</svg>

## Shear stress and viscosity
The shear stress $\tau$ (unit of pressure: Pa), is the ratio of shear forces $F$ per unit area $A$:
$\tau=\frac{F}{A} = \mu {\frac {du}{dy}}$

with $\mu$ the viscosity (in Pa*s), and $\frac{du}{dy}$ the velocity gradient perpendicular to the flow direction (m/s per m = $s^{-1}$)

**Viscosity of water at $20^{\circ} C$ is $10^{-3}$ Pa.s**

## Bernouilli's equation + friction factor

A head loss term $h_l$ is added to Bernouilli's equation to account for total head losses due to friction:

\[H = z+{\frac {p}{\rho g}}+{\frac {v^{2}}{2g}} +h_l=h+{\frac {v^{2}}{2g}}+h_l\]

$h_l$ can be expressed as a function of a dimensionless friction factor $f$:

$h_l=f*\frac{L.v^2}{D*2g}$
where L and D are the length and diameter of the pipe

# Types of flows

## Laminar vs turbulent flows
> - **What kind flows can we have (from a fluid dynamics perspectice)?**
> - Laminar flow occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers (viscous forces are dominant). Flow in slow canals can be laminar
> - Turbulent flow characterized by sudden changes in pressure and flow velocity (inertial forces are dominant). White water, wind behind an obstacle are turbulent

## Characterizing turbulent flow: Reynolds number
The Reynolds number is defined as

$Re =\frac{\rho vL}{\mu }$

where: $\rho$ is the density of the fluid (kg/m3)

$v$ is a characteristic velocity (m/s), mean velocity in our case

$L$ is a characteristic linear dimension. In the case of a pipe, it is its diameter

$\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa.s or N.s/m2 or kg/(m·s))



## Reynolds number example

$Re < 2000$ usually qualifies as laminar
$Re > 4000$ is clearly turbulent.
In between is a transition between those 2 flow regimes

> - **Example: Water at 20c ($\mu = 10^{-3}$), flowing at 0.1m/s in a 10cm wide pipe:**
> - **Calculate the Reynolds number:** $Re =\frac{\rho vL}{\mu }$
> - $Re = 0.1*0.1*1000/10^{-3} = 10 000 > 4000$
> - So the flow in the pipe is turbulent

## Poiseuille Law for laminar flow
Can be derived theoretically

$v =-\frac{dh}{ds} \frac{\rho g D^{2}}{32\mu}$

$v$ is the water velocity in the pipe
$\frac{dh}{ds}$ is the hydraulic head gradient over the length of pipe (often the slope of the pipe, but not always),

$\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity,

$D$ is the pipe diameter.

## Hazen Williams equation for turbulent flow
It is an empirical formula used to deisgn water networks, irrigation systems... 

$v=C{\sqrt{RS}}$

$v$ is the water velocity in the pipe

C is a roughness coefficient

R is the hydraulic radius (pipe radius in case of a pipe)

S is the slope of the pipe

## Take home messages

- Bernouilli equation: conservation of total head if we ignore friction
- Frictional losses of energy create head losses
- If head losses are important, they must be added to Bernouilli's Law
- Viscosity is temperature dependent. Is ratio of shear stress / velocity gradient
- Viscosity of water at 20c is 1*10^-3 Pa.s
- Reynolds number measures importance of viscous forces
- If Reynolds number > 2000, then turbulent flow
- Friction factor for laminar pipe flow: f = 64/R
- This gives the mean velocity of laminar flow in a pipe (Poiseuille)
- Mean velocity proportional to $D^2$ for laminar flow and $D^{1/2}$ for turbulent flow
