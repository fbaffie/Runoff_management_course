## Vocabulary
> - **Rising limb** 
> - The rising limb of hydro graph, also known as concentration curve, reflects a prolonged increase in discharge from a catchment area, typically in response to a rainfall event
> - **Recession (or falling) limb** 
> - The recession limb extends from the peak flow rate onward. The end of stormflow (a.k.a. quickflow or direct runoff) and the return to groundwater-derived flow (base flow) is often taken as the point of inflection of the recession limb. The recession limb represents the withdrawal of water from the storage built up in the basin during the earlier phases of the hydrograph.

> - **Peak discharge**
> - The highest point on the hydro graph when the rate of discharge is greatest

## Vocabulary
> - **Lag time** 
> - The time interval from the center of mass of rainfall excess to the peak of the resulting hydrograph

> - **Time to peak** 
> - Time interval from the start of the resulting hydro graph

> - **Discharge** 
> - the rate of flow (volume per unit time) passing a specific location in a river or other channel

# Runoff from small catchments

## Rational method
Recommended for catchments up to 5$km^2$.
Sogndal's overvassnorm, as in Lindholm (2008), recommends up to 0.5$km^2$ (50 Ha)

$Q = C * i * A * S$ where:

$Q$ is discharge ($m^3/s$), 

$C$ is a runoff coefficient, 

$i$ is the precipitation intensity ($m/s$),

$A$ is the contributing catchment area ($m^2$) and $S$ is a safety (and climate change) factor

## Runoff coefficient and land use
Concrete, asphalt, bare rock: 0.6-0.9

Gravel roads: 0.3-0.7

Agricultural and grass areas: 0.2-0.5

Forests: 0.2-0.5

C should be adapted to the duration D of the rain event (NVE / Vegvesen veileder):

- If D < 1h: better to use the lower value
- If D > 3h: better to use the higher value

## Runoff coefficient and design return period
If the return period is high, increase the value of C:

25-year event: +10%

50-year event: +20%

100-year event: +25%

200-year event: +30%

## Safety / climate factor

Sogndal's overvassnorm recommends a safety factor $S=1.2$. 

Vegvesen goes up to $S=1.5$ for long lasting infrastructure

## Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curve
Which precipitation event should we choose for peak discharge?

## Time of concentration
<img src="images/time_of_concentration.gif" height="300" width="auto">

Time when 100% of the catchment area contributes to discharge at the outlet:

Also the longest time taken by surface runoff to reach the outlet

## Time of concentration

Concentration time $T$ for natural catchments (non urbanized)
$T=0.6*L*H^{-0.5}+3000*P_l$

For urban catchments:

$T=0.02*L^{1.15}*H^{-0.39}$

where $L$ is the length of the longest flow path in the catchment

$H$ the total height difference of the catchment

$P_{l}$ the percentage of lake area in the catchment

<!--
## Time of concentration

> - **For rain events of equal intensity, which parameter will affect peak discharge at the outlet of the basin?**
> - The duration of the rain event
> - **What is the minimum duration to leads to the highest discharge?**
> - The "lag time" or "concentration time" of the catchment

-->

## Time of concentration

Other possible methods:

- Hydraulic routing formulas for surface runoff through the catchment (open channel flow, sheet flow...)
- Hydrological modelling of the whole catchment
- Measuring the (hydrograph) response of the catchment to a typical rain event


## Example: proposed development

## Example: measuring active runoff surfaces
<img src="images/surfaces_actives.png" height="400" width="auto">

Does this level of precision make sense?

## Runoff curve number (only as an example)
Popular method in the USA:

\[Q = \begin{cases}0\ \ \text{for }P<I_{a}\\{\frac{(P-I_a)^2}{P-I_a+S}\ \ \text{for }P>I_a}\end{cases}\]

where $Q$ is runoff, $P$ is rainfall, $S$ is the potential maximum soil moisture retention after runoff begins, $I_a$ is the initial interception / depression storage

$S = \frac{1000}{CN}-10$ where $CN$ ranges from 30 to 100; lower numbers indicate low runoff potential while larger numbers are for increasing runoff potential. Numbers depend on antecedent moisture conditions

## Take home messages

- A variety of empirical formulas for the response of small catchments to precipitation
- Runoff coefficients are a conceptual simplification of infiltration / retention processes
- Time of concentration: longest time taken by rain on the catchment to reach the outlet
- Time of concentration decreases with increase urbanization / impermeabilization
- Follow your local guidelines, understand the limitations and maybe look for improvements
- Keep in mind the assumptions and how much precision really makes sense
- SW control at the source will always help downstream: slow it, spread it and sink it.
- Always keep in mind where the overflow will go
