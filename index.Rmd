# HYDROLOGY

## The water cycle
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](01_Hydrology/1_water_cycle.html)

We look at different components of the water cycle before diving into more detail.
Climate change will impact various components of the hydrological cycle. We will quickly review potential evolutions and base our first quizz on this theme.


Quiz for next monday:

Send me 2 questions and answers on this scientific presentation: [Sonia Seneviratne - Effects of land hydrology on atmospheric processes and climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMjchti6LdM)

Or on this book chapter of "Global environmental change":
[water cycles and climate change](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/trenbert/trenberth.papers/Hydrological%20cycleSpringer.pdf)


<!--

[Quiz](01_Hydrology/1_water_cycle_quiz.html)

"Hydrology is the science which deals with terrestrial waters, their occurrence, circulation and distribution on our planet, their physical and chemical properties and their interaction with the physical and biological environment, including the effect on them of the activity of man".



Session time plan:
- Brainstorming:

Ask students to prepare a sketch of the water cycle. They put their name on the backside of the sheet.
Keep each student's sketch, make a copy and put it on the website.

- Discuss the student's suggestions and create a master-sketch on the board.

What other "cycles" do they know? should we have a catch-up on the carbon cycle? How are the different cycles inter-related?

This is a good opportunity to see what was forgotten and small discussing the relative importance of each element.
Introduce numbers now, or get students to estimate some of them.

Exercise on R: 
Sogndal catchment using historical data: catchment size, catchment altitude, catchment mean slope, % of the various land uses, mean annual flow, mean annual snow cover at Anestølen (how many days of snow cover), how many days of precipitation? mean precipitation, median precipication, mean glacier ablation rate, cumulated glacier ablation rate.

-->

## Hydrological processes
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

We will first discuss hydrological processes most relevant to hydrology in Norway: snow hydrology and vegetation processes: [Lecture](01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_1.html)

We then cover groundwater, soil water and runoff generation which are important for the design of green stormwater infrastructure: [Lecture](01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_2.html)

## Hydrological extremes
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](01_Hydrology/3_hydrological_extremes.html)

Quantifying floods and droughts helps better designing protection / adaptation measures. 

Quiz for next monday:

Send me 2 questions and answers on this scientific article:
[A restatement of the natural science evidence concerning catchment-based ‘natural’ flood management in the UK](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/473/2199/20160706?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Proceedings_A_TrendMD_1)

## Hydrological modelling
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](01_Hydrology/4_hydrological_modelling.html)

Being able to model streamflow helps make better management decisions such as sizing of reservoirs, culverts or allowances for irrigation. We will look at different modelling concepts used in hydrology, their data requirements, forecasting abilities and limitations.

<!--

# HYDRAULICS

## Fluid dynamics
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/1_fluid_dynamics.html)

We will look at water in pressure pipes. This is usually the domain of drinking water only but in somes instances, SW will have to be pumped out of a depression. Alternatively, SW could be used in off-grid design for micro-hydropower production or gravity fed irrigation schemes.

Quiz for next monday:

Send me 2 questions and answers on this NVE report:
[Identification of areas exposed to flooding in Norway at a national level](https://gis3.nve.no/metadata/rapporter/SmallScaleFloodAssesment_v3.pdf)

<!--
Microhydro, ram pump, pumps, off the grid gravity fed networks...
-->

## Open channel hydraulics
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/2_open_channel.html)

How much flow can an open channel convey? How high will the water level be for a specifc discharge rate and slope?
Those questions are important when sizing infrastructure or defining the extend of flood zones.

<!--
Irrigation schemes in the US west (Arizona, maps and drawings?). Open water irrigation schemes
-->

## Soils, erosion and deposition
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/3_erosion_deposition.html)

Water can mobilize particules of various sizes. In extreme cases, boulders can be taken with the flow and form devastating debris flows.
On the other hand, the smallest suspended particules are those that carry most pollution in SW runoff

<!--

## Urban hydraulics
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/4_urban_hydraulics.html)

We will try to summarize how hydrology and hydraulic come into play for the design of (green) SW infrastructure.
this will involve simplified calculations for small catchments.

# CATCHMENT SCALE FLOODING

## Flood vulnerability assessment
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
<!--
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/1_floodplain_management.html)
-->

We saw how precipitation led to runoff and how water level in channels varies as a function of discharge.
Those results are used to produce flood zoning maps. We will look at different methods to do so and discuss assessment of vulnerability to flooding.

Quiz for next monday:
Send me 4 questions and answers on your group project.


<!--

-->

## Flood protection works
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">

Based on flood zoning maps and the quantification of hydrological extremes in specifc catchments, protection measures can be designed. Those consist of riverbank engineering features such as dikes, diverting channels. We will look at a simple design during an exercise session

This session consists of a full-day excursion with Svein Vågane from NVE Førde.
We will look at flash flooding that occured in [Utvik last autumn](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/vaer-og-uvaer/flommen-i-utvik-vann-ekspert-varslet-om-flomfare/a/24103915/)

<!--
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/2_flood_protection.html)
Quiz / exercises on the infrastructure in Laerdal
-->

<!--
## Hydropower and flooding
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/3_hydropower_management.html)

Hydropower reservoirs can store substantial amounts of water and can therefore be managed specifically to avoid flooding downstream.
Flood forecasting becomes particularly important as a reservoir may first need emptying before acting as a damper to a flooding event. We will focus on a case study in Zürich, Switzerland. 

Quiz / exercises on the Swiss case studies and possibilities in Norway.
-->

## Land use 
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/4_land_use.html)

We will see how alternative land uses may help mitigate catchment-scale flooding and erosion. Some agricultural practices could be applied in urban areas to link SW green infrastrure to local food production.

<!--
Key words: urban stormwater agriculture, permaculture

# URBAN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

## Introduction to green SW infrastructure
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
<!--
[Lecture by Kyrre Groven (Vestland Forskning)](04_Urban_SW/1_introduction.html)
-->

Lecture by Kyrre Groven (Vestland Forskning)

We will look at the history of reticulated networks for SW and sewage. What are their limitations?
Which pollution and flooding problems can be caused by sW runoff?
Green SW infrastructure techniques will be introduced.

<!-- KYRRE
- Start with brainstorming keywords and a conceptual sketch
- Exercises on the network in Sogndal and the potential / difficulties associated with green infrastructure in Sogndal / Norway.
Get students to brainstorm on potential green infrastructure techniques. Then list a few and ask them to draw how they think those features should be designed.
Then present some typical drawings, discuss and get them to explore further for the next session.
-->

## Green SW infrastructure  
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
<!--
[Lecture](04_Urban_SW/2_constraints.html)
-->

Lecture by Eli Heiberg (HVL)

Role of green infrastructure in urban storm water management:

Principles, measures and technology for local, open runoff management. 
We will also discuss the multifunctionality of green infrastructure

[Quiz](04_Urban_SW/2_green_infra_quiz.html)

<!-- ELI

This session will focus on green SW infrastructure and their non-physical design constraints.
Those include cost and maintenance issues, social acceptance, multifunctionality (depollution, recreation, agriculture).
What are the responsibilities of decision makers regarding the design of such infrastructure?
Which official design guidelines exist and why do they matter?

- Quiz: discuss paper "Stormwater management and urban planning:Lessons from 40 years of innovation"
- Lecture topics:
National guidelines in development
Maintenance aspects
Social acceptance (recreational use, ready to do some maintenance?, understanding of the risks)
Relation between private developers, private design firms and municipalities (do all waters assets typically get vested to council in Norway?)
Do the municipalities have specific requirements for new developments? If not, what should they do and how?
Constructive critiscm on the blue/green factor method could be used as an exercise.
- Exercises or maybe project presentation / discussion as this session might come early in the course
-->

## Designing resilient infrastructure
<img src="images/logo.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](04_Urban_SW/3_design.html)

We look at some good and bad design examples and try to understand the reasons behing design choices and possibly unintended consequences / uses. Some examples focus on SW infrastructures but not all, in an effort to distinguish important design principles and constraints. This includes legibility. practicallity, multi-functionnality...

<!--
Quiz / exercises on design calculations / drawings (redesign the campus?)
Or ask everyone to come with 1 example of good and bad design on the campus (or in Sogndal). Could be water-related but also other.
The example of bad design should come with a suggested better option.
- Brainstorming:
Ask students to brainstorm their ideas on good design principles for resilient SW infrastructure / water resources management
- Lecture linking all previous elements: hydrology, hydraulics, non-technical constraints.
- Design exercises
