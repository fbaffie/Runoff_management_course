## Something about you!
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

- Where do you come from?
- What have you studied?
- Motivation for the master?
- Motivation for this course?!
- Master project idea?
- Post-master plans?

<!--
Ask students to prepare a sketch of their ideas/interests on the course based on the learning outcomes and some hints. 
They put their name on the backside of the sheet.
Discuss it an create a master-sketch on the board.
Keep each student's sketch, make a copy and put it on the website.
Print all the keywords and get 3-4 groups of students to build a conceptual map of the course
-->

## Course plan
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

Approximately half of the course will be focused on the basics of:

- Hydrology: how rainfall becomes streamflow?
- Hydraulics: how water moves in open channels and under pressure?

Before looking at two quite disctinct scenarios (in Norway):

- Catchment scale flooding: how to deal with large-scale flooding?
- Urban stormwater (SW) and flooding: how to best manage urbanized catchments?

## Learning outcomes
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

Knowledge of:

- the different components in the hydrological cycle and local water balance
- the challenges and possibilities related to local runoff management
- erosion and sediment transport in catchments and related mitigation measures
- land use planning for local runoff management
- potential impacts of climate change on water resources

## Skills
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

- Understand hydrological and hydraulics processes.
- Make simple hydrological, hydrogeological  and hydraulic calculations relevant to runoff management. 
- Use processes understanding to have a critical view on those calculations
- Provide input for action plans and suggests solutions for local runoff management
- Use different measuring techniques and carry out simple dimensional calculations of green infrastructure systems for urban runoff management
- Use relevant computer software and GIS to identify flood-prone areas and potential problems arising from urban flooding and runoff 

## Teaching philosophy
<img src="images/Quote_papert.jpeg" height="230" width="auto">

"It is essential to see lectures as a means of helping students learn to think about the key concepts of a particular subject, rather than primarily as a means of transferring knowledge from instructor to student."

## Teaching philosophy

- Open source text-based material (for collaboration), available [online](https://fbaffie.github.io/Runoff_management_course/)
- Links to a lot freely available material
- Lots of questions to force thinking / active learning
- Open to a variety of projects this year

Given those course design choices:

- Be active: take part in brainstorming exercises and questions
- Be creative in your projects
- Don't hesitate to ask questions and reach for help
- Give feedback: The course is a living document, please suggest improvements!

<!--
1.  Intellectual Community
2.  A high degree of interactivity between instructor and student, as well as between students.
3.  Active Learning
4.  Reflection
5.  Self-directed Learning

This master programm introduces you to a lot of material, which is good to give you different perspectices and widen your horizons, but it presents the risk of covering too supercially key concepts.
In order to achieve the difficult balance between those 2 aspects, I have choosen to have simple lectures on important processes and concepts, backed by group exercises on specific case studies or scientific findings. A substantial list of written and video resources is listed at the end of each topic.

It is a bit hypocritical to tell you not to do copy/paste, as I do it and it is very human to do it...
My role is to orient you in the best way to book and interent resources for the future, while forcing you to have some internet-free discoveries during the course. The wealth of information available to us is both a miracle and a curse!

Mark said that students were lacking pro-activity. He was maybe right.

<!--
Implementing change requires strong convincing / argumentation abilities. Developing alternative ways to manage stormwater is for example much more difficult from an organizational point of view than from a technical aspect.
There are probably smart introverts in your group that I hope will contribute actively.

# HYDROLOGY

## The water cycle
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](01_Hydrology/1_water_cycle.html)

We look at different components of the water cycle before diving into more detail.

[Quiz](01_Hydrology/1_water_cycle_quiz.html)


<!--
"Hydrology is the science which deals with terrestrial waters, their occurrence, circulation and distribution on our planet, their physical and chemical properties and their interaction with the physical and biological environment, including the effect on them of the activity of man".

Session time plan:
- Brainstorming:

Ask students to prepare a sketch of the water cycle. They put their name on the backside of the sheet.
Keep each student's sketch, make a copy and put it on the website.

- Discuss the student's suggestions and create a master-sketch on the board.

What other "cycles" do they know? should we have a catch-up on the carbon cycle? How are the different cycles inter-related?

This is a good opportunity to see what was forgotten and small discussing the relative importance of each element.
Introduce numbers now, or get students to estimate some of them.

Exercise on R: try to do general functions that could quickly be used with other catchments (I NEED TO PREPARE A PARAMETRIZED NOTEBOOK) 
Sogndal catchment using historical data: catchment size, catchment altitude, catchment mean slope, % of the various land uses, mean annual flow, mean annual snow cover at Anestølen (how many days of snow cover), how many days of precipitation? mean precipitation, median precipication, mean glacier ablation rate, cumulated glacier ablation rate.

Why does it rain more in Fjaerland than in Sogndal? Why is it warmer...

- Quick lecture on what was not covered
- Do exercises on the water cycle and start linking to the next sessions
- Quiz theme: general knowledge on the water cycle in various parts of the world
-->

## Hydrological processes
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

We will first discuss hydrological processes most relevant to hydrology in Norway: snow hydrology and vegetation processes: [Lecture](01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_1.html)

We then cover groundwater, soil water and runoff generation which are important for the design of green stormwater infrastructure: [Lecture](01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_2.html)

The quiz focuses on the impact of forest on water resources: [Quiz](01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_quiz.html)

<!--

Schaochun: too many tress in germany? emptying aquifers?
Stephanie's project

Discuss specific hydrological processes with students before the lecture to get an understanding of their intuitions or previous knowledge.
This could maybe also be written down and collected for research purposes.
Present documents for the quiz: impact of forest on hydrological resources
-->


## Hydrological extremes
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](01_Hydrology/3_hydrological_extremes.html)

Quantifying floods and droughts helps better designing protection / adaptation measures. 

<!--
- Brainstorming hydrological extremes
Discuss hydrological extremes with students before the lecture to get an understanding of their intuitions or previous knowledge.
This could maybe also be written down and collected for research purposes.

- Present the slides
- Do some exercises. computer??
Box plot / historgram of precipitation and discharge for the sogndal catchment. Seasonality of rain events. Trends?
Fit some distributions to the historical data: annual maximum, peak over threshold...


- Present documents for the quiz: extremes in California / mediteranean climates? or my work at NVE?
-->

## Hydrological modelling
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](01_Hydrology/4_hydrological_modelling.html)

Being able to model streamflow helps make better management decisions such as sizing of reservoirs, culverts or allowances for irrigation. We will look at different modelling concepts used in hydrology, their data requirements, forecasting abilities and limitations.

<!--
Discuss hydrological modelling with students before the lecture to get an understanding of their intuitions or previous knowledge.
This could maybe also be written down and collected for research purposes.

Flood generating processes in the Sogndal catchment.
Linear reservoir model
Landscape-based reservoirs...
Rational method
-->

# HYDRAULICS

## Fluid dynamics
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/1_fluid_dynamics.html)

We will look at water in pressure pipes. This is usually the domain of drinking water only but in somes instances, SW will have to be pumped out of a depression. Alternatively, SW could be used in off-grid design for micro-hydropower production or gravity fed irrigation schemes.

<!--
Microhydro, ram pump, pumps, off the grid gravity fed networks...
-->

## Open channel hydraulics
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/2_open_channel.html)

How much flow can an open channel convey? How high will the water level be for a specifc discharge rate and slope?
Those questions are important when sizing infrastructure or defining the extend of flood zones.

<!--
Irrigation schemes in the US west (Arizona, maps and drawings?). Open water irrigation schemes
-->

## Soils, erosion and deposition
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/3_erosion_deposition.html)

Water can mobilize particules of various sizes. In extreme cases, boulders can be taken with the flow and form devastating debris flows.
On the other hand, the smallest suspended particules are those that carry most pollution in SW runoff

<!--

## Urban hydraulics
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](02_Hydraulics/4_urban_hydraulics.html)

We will try to summarize how hydrology and hydraulic come into play for the design of (green) SW infrastructure.
this will involve simplified calculations for small catchments.

# CATCHMENT SCALE FLOODING

## Floodplain management
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
<!--
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/1_floodplain_management.html)
-->
Lecture by Deborah Davies (HVL) on natural flood management.

We saw how precipitation led to runoff and how water level in channels varies as a function of discharge.
Those results are used to produce flood zoning maps. We will now focus on the bigger picture of flood management in large catchments.

<!--

-->

## Flood protection works
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

Based on flood zoning maps and the quantification of hydrological extremes in specifc catchments, protection measures can be designed. Those consist of dikes, diverting channels.

This session consists of a full-day excursion with Sven Vågane from NVE Førde.

<!--
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/2_flood_protection.html)
Quiz / exercises on the infrastructure in Laerdal
-->

<!--
## Hydropower and flooding
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/3_hydropower_management.html)

Hydropower reservoirs can store substantial amounts of water and can therefore be managed specifically to avoid flooding downstream.
Flood forecasting becomes particularly important as a reservoir may first need emptying before acting as a damper to a flooding event. We will focus on a case study in Zürich, Switzerland. 

Quiz / exercises on the Swiss case studies and possibilities in Norway.
-->

## Land use 
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](03_Catchment_scale/4_land_use.html)

We will see how alternative land uses may help mitigate catchment-scale flooding and erosion. Some agricultural practices could be applied in urban areas to link SW green infrastrure to local food production.

<!--
Key words: urban stormwater agriculture, permaculture
Potential quiz / discussion: http://www.monbiot.com/2015/12/08/a-storm-of-ignorance/ Village homes in Davis Versaland? Willie Smits in Indonesia?
Flood's ecological functions, bridge between rural land use and urban flooding
Session in collaboration with Deborah: we could use the the scotish case study in Gairlochy (changes in rural land use and protection measures to avoid urban flooding lead to rural flooding and erosion problems)
-->


# URBAN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

## Introduction to green SW infrastructure
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
<!--
[Lecture by Kyrre Groven (Vestland Forskning)](04_Urban_SW/1_introduction.html)
-->

Lecture by Kyrre Groven (Vestland Forskning)

We will look at the history of reticulated networks for SW and sewage. What are their limitations?
Which pollution and flooding problems can be caused by sW runoff?
Green SW infrastructure techniques will be introduced.

<!-- KYRRE
- Start with brainstorming keywords and a conceptual sketch
- Exercises on the network in Sogndal and the potential / difficulties associated with green infrastructure in Sogndal / Norway.
Get students to brainstorm on potential green infrastructure techniques. Then list a few and ask them to draw how they think those features should be designed.
Then present some typical drawings, discuss and get them to explore further for the next session.
-->

## Green SW infrastructure  
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
<!--
[Lecture](04_Urban_SW/2_constraints.html)
-->

Lecture by Eli Heiberg (HVL)

Role of green infrastructure in urban storm water management:

Principles, measures and technology for local, open runoff management. 
We will also discuss the multifunctionality of green infrastructure

[Quiz](04_Urban_SW/2_green_infra_quiz.html)

<!-- ELI

This session will focus on green SW infrastructure and their non-physical design constraints.
Those include cost and maintenance issues, social acceptance, multifunctionality (depollution, recreation, agriculture).
What are the responsibilities of decision makers regarding the design of such infrastructure?
Which official design guidelines exist and why do they matter?

- Quiz: discuss paper "Stormwater management and urban planning:Lessons from 40 years of innovation"
- Lecture topics:
National guidelines in development
Maintenance aspects
Social acceptance (recreational use, ready to do some maintenance?, understanding of the risks)
Relation between private developers, private design firms and municipalities (do all waters assets typically get vested to council in Norway?)
Do the municipalities have specific requirements for new developments? If not, what should they do and how?
Constructive critiscm on the blue/green factor method could be used as an exercise.
- Exercises or maybe project presentation / discussion as this session might come early in the course
-->

## Designing resilient infrastructure
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">
[Lecture](04_Urban_SW/3_design.html)

We look at some good and bad design examples and try to understand the reasons behing design choices and possibly unintended consequences / uses. Some examples focus on SW infrastructures but not all, in an effort to distinguish important design principles and constraints. This includes legibility. practicallity, multi-functionnality...

<!--
Quiz / exercises on design calculations / drawings (redesign the campus?)
Or ask everyone to come with 1 example of good and bad design on the campus (or in Sogndal). Could be water-related but also other.
The example of bad design should come with a suggested better option.
- Brainstorming:
Ask students to brainstorm their ideas on good design principles for resilient SW infrastructure / water resources management
- Lecture linking all previous elements: hydrology, hydraulics, non-technical constraints.
- Design exercises
-->

- Animate the discussion.
- During the 10 day period before the exam, every project gets a 2-hour block of my time.

<!--
For example students would work on a project that develops their weak point why being client on a topic they feel more at ease with.

## Project reporting and presentation
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

- The reports are sent to fkba@hvl.no and uploaded to fronter: Friday 9th of June. 24:00 
- Slide show of 5 minutes per person (so 15 or 20 min total depending on the group)
- Videos could be part of the reporting, but not only
- The group with the same "second project" as the presenters gets priority for questions. They should have read the "second project" report in detail.
- The individual exam will then discuss the personal project, the second project and the course material

## Assessment
<img src="images/PPT_Body.png" class="cover">

1. Written group project work (+ oral presentation). The group gets one common grading. If not approved, a new version of the project work must be handed in. Grading A-F.
2. Individual in-depth oral discussion on the project work, the "second" project and finally some aspects of the course material (remembering the most difficult equations will not be required, but they should be qualitatively understood and you should have an idea on how to apply them).
Grading A-F.

Most graphs / pictures from others are not explicitely referenced in the presentations to avoid surcharging them.
I tried to save them all in specific pinterest collections (also serves as a list of interesting websites):
