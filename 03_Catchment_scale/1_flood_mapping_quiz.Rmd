## Astrid


What are the 4 different approaches to derive the maximum rise of water levels depending on the availability of data?

- Data from gauging stations (discharge, waterlevels) 
- Catchment characteristics (catchment area, lake percentage, specific runoff) 
- Catchment area 
- Comparable rivers in the same area. 



What are uncertainties and inaccuracies of the hydrological method?
 
- Accuracy of the used Terrain model 
- Use of Terrain model to obtain water levels 
- Uncertainty in maximum rise of water level 
- Implementation of regional different values 
- Disregarding local hydraulic conditions (underestimation) 



## Sushmitha Kotipalli

What are the equations used to calculate the rise of water level?
Area
0-1   km2: dH(m) = 2
1-500 km2: dH(m) = 0,965 ln(Area) + 2 
>500 km2: dH(m) = 8 
0-1 km2: dH(m) = 2,83 + 0,00027 * Area + 0,0009 * Runoff – 0,15 Lake%
1-500 km2: dH(m) = 2,83 + 0,00027 * Area + 0,0009 * Runoff – 0,15 Lake% + 0,64 ln(Area) 
>500 km2: dH(m) = 6,83 + 0,00027 * Area + 0,0009 * Runoff – 0,15 Lake%

## Anne

1.	Which 4 different approaches were used depending on the availability of hydrological data?
Answer 
- Data from gauging stations
- Catchment characteristics
- Catchment area
- Comparable rivers in the same area

2. What does a hydrologic correct DTM mean?
Answer
It means that the DTM has been corrected in a way the calculated flow paths follow the actual rivers and streams.

QUESTION 1: (page 6-8/22)
According to the methodology “the main focus has been to investigate the possibility to derive areas prone to flooding based on […] national DTM. Methods used for small scale flood assessment in other countries […] were studied.” Due to several factors these methods were not suitable for Norway. Explain the geomorphological approach, which was implemented instead. Name critic as well.
ANSWER: (geomorphology)
Main hypothesis: flat areas bordering river systems were created due to sedimentation and thus prone to flooding!
Definition of flat area: NVE uses the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) in comparison with the preexisting “flood inundation map”. The threshold value was found within ≤ 3 degree. Only areas that are interconnected with the river system. 

Critic: 
“Overestimation of potential flood areas” takes place in complex river systems, where many tributary rivers exist and a differentiation between flood plains and general flat areas is no longer possible.
Underestimation happens in areas where the “flood water level” is above the ordinary altitude and the water in reality reaches areas “that are less than the 3 degree threshold that was used in the method”.
Inaccuracy of the DTM – works with a “coarse” of resolution of 25x25m. 



QUESTION 2: (page 9/22)
Define the idea of the second (hydrological) approach and explain the setup of a “virtual water divide” (watershed).
ANSWER: (hydrology)
Idea: The idea is to define a method for calculating the “potential maximum rise of water levels in various kinds of rivers” as the very first. These data (flood water level) need to be interpolated to a flood plain. Combined with the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) it is possible to determine the potential inundation areas.
Virtual Water Divide: This method was implemented for calculating a flood plain without using measured cross sections. Therefor 25m buffers are calculated around the river. Each buffer belongs to a certain altitude / elevation (e. g. “first buffer is 1m, second buffer is 2m etc.”). Thereby the watershed in the virtual model is located on the highest altitude and in the centered in the middle between two rivers.


##Tonje Karin Rio

> - **Give a brief explanation of the geomorphological- and the hydrological method, and what these methods investigate.**

> - 
These methods are used for flood risk mapping at a national level, and is adjusted to Norwegian conditions.  

Geomorphological method: Using our national DTM, flat areas (below a 3 degree threshold derived from existing flood inundation maps) in vicinity of rivers were identified as prone to flooding.
 
Hydrological method: Rise of water levels from detailed flood inundation maps have been correlated with discharge and catchment characteristics, then applied to comparable rivers across Norway. Combining maximum flood levels with the DTM, areas prone to flooding were detected.

> - **When compared to detailed flood inundation maps, which of the two methods discussed in this paper have the best fit?**

> - Results from the hydrological method show a good match with detailed flood inundation maps, and is considered the best method for mapping areas prone to flooding. The geomorphological method encountered problems with under- and overestimation of flood levels. 


## Sarina

Which two factors should be combined to find potentially inundated areas in Norway?
•	The flood plane data
•	The digital terrain model (DTM)
How are flood levels being calculated in Finland?
Flood levels are being calculated using Bernoulli’s and Manning’s equations with standard river profiles. Afterwards the water levels are  being extrapolated using advanced GIS methods based on cost allocation.

## Famke 

1. In how many levels is the planning process of municipalities split? Name and explain them briefly.
1. Municipal plan: giving principal strategies for land use within the municipality, 
2. Zoning plans: where specific areas are zoned for different land use with detailed regulations
3. Building case: where the processing of building application is done. 


2. Combining the flood plain with the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) solves 2 fundamental problems, which?

1. Water levels on the mouth of a tributary do not necessarily depend on runoff or field characteristics, but being influenced by the main river
2. virtual DTM water divide lies beyond actual water divide

## Willemijn Ogg

> - **What is a hydrologic correct DTM?**

> - A hydrologic correct DTM means the DTM has been corrected in a way the calculated flow paths follow the actual rivers and streams.  

> - ** Why isn't is so important to study the effect of using regionally differentiated formulas for calculating the maximum water level rise in the hydrological model? **

> - Due to the flat topography of the valley floor, the hydrological method is relatively insensitive to the exact water level rise. Inaccuracy in the calculated flood levels has little effect on the models result.  

## Helge

Question 1
DTM – National 25x25m digital terrain was used in the mapping. What are the main limitation and what is the consequences?
Answer
Resolution and accuracy. The DTM is made from contours with 10m and 20m equidistance from base maps in scale of 1:50 000. The accuracy is one of the limitations, and the std. is between 4 and 6m. With the use of this coarse data, not only details will be lost, but also (relatively) larger slopes and flat terrain can be overseen by the data.

Question 2
The parameters used in the Hydrological method have inaccuracy. What are these?
Answer
The inaccuracy in the parameters leads to a significant uncertainty in the results. 
-	Accuracy of the used 
-	Use of DTM to obtain water levels
-	Uncertainty in maximum rise of water level
-	Implementation of regional different values
-	Disregarding local hydraulic conditions (underestimation)


## Vibeke
> - ** What is the main hypothesis in the geomorphological, slope analysis and river network approach**
> -The main hypothesis is that flat areas in the vicinity of rivers were created in a process of sedimentation and thus prone to flooding. So by identifying the flat areas in the terrain, potensial flooding prone areas can be identified.
 
## Vibeke
> - **In Finland, flood levels are calculated with the use of the Bernoulli’s and Mannings equation with standard river profiles. Why is this approach not applicable for use in Norway
> -The variation in the Norwegian terrain makes their equation not applicable for mapping flood levels.
