<h2>Nils</h2>
<!-- QUESTION 1: (page 6-8/22) -->
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>According to the methodology “the main focus has been to investigate the possibility to derive areas prone to flooding based on […] national DTM. Methods used for small scale flood assessment in other countries […] were studied.” Due to several factors these methods were not suitable for Norway. Explain the geomorphological approach, which was implemented instead. Name critic as well.</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Geomorphology - Main hypothesis: flat areas bordering river systems were created due to sedimentation and thus prone to flooding! Definition of flat area: NVE uses the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) in comparison with the preexisting “flood inundation map”. The threshold value was found within ≤ 3 degree. Only areas that are interconnected with the river system.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="nils-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Nils</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Critic: “Overestimation of potential flood areas” takes place in complex river systems, where many tributary rivers exist and a differentiation between flood plains and general flat areas is no longer possible. Underestimation happens in areas where the “flood water level” is above the ordinary altitude and the water in reality reaches areas “that are less than the 3 degree threshold that was used in the method”. Inaccuracy of the DTM – works with a “coarse” of resolution of 25x25m.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="nils-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Nils</h2>
<!-- QUESTION 2: (page 9/22) -->
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Define the idea of the second (hydrological) approach and explain the setup of a “virtual water divide” (watershed)</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The idea is to define a method for calculating the “potential maximum rise of water levels in various kinds of rivers” as the very first. These data (flood water level) need to be interpolated to a flood plain. Combined with the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) it is possible to determine the potential inundation areas.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="nils-3" class="slide level2">
<h2>Nils</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Virtual Water Divide: This method was implemented for calculating a flood plain without using measured cross sections. Therefor 25m buffers are calculated around the river. Each buffer belongs to a certain altitude / elevation (e. g. “first buffer is 1m, second buffer is 2m etc.”). Thereby the watershed in the virtual model is located on the highest altitude and in the centered in the middle between two rivers.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="tonje-karin-rio" class="slide level2">
<h2>Tonje Karin Rio</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Give a brief explanation of the geomorphological- and the hydrological method, and what these methods investigate.</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">These methods are used for flood risk mapping at a national level, and is adjusted to Norwegian conditions.<br />
</li>
<li class="fragment next">Geomorphological method: Using our national DTM, flat areas (below a 3 degree threshold derived from existing flood inundation maps) in vicinity of rivers were identified as prone to flooding.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="tonje-karin-rio-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Tonje Karin Rio</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Hydrological method: Rise of water levels from detailed flood inundation maps have been correlated with discharge and catchment characteristics, then applied to comparable rivers across Norway. Combining maximum flood levels with the DTM, areas prone to flooding were detected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>When compared to detailed flood inundation maps, which of the two methods discussed in this paper have the best fit?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Results from the hydrological method show a good match with detailed flood inundation maps, and is considered the best method for mapping areas prone to flooding. The geomorphological method encountered problems with under- and overestimation of flood levels.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="sarina" class="slide level2">
<h2>Sarina</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which two factors should be combined to find potentially inundated areas in Norway?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The flood plane data</li>
<li class="fragment next">The digital terrain model (DTM)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>How are flood levels being calculated in Finland?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Flood levels are being calculated using Bernoulli’s and Manning’s equations with standard river profiles. Afterwards the water levels are being extrapolated using advanced GIS methods based on cost allocation.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="famke" class="slide level2">
<h2>Famke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>In how many levels is the planning process of municipalities split? Name and explain them briefly.</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Municipal plan: giving principal strategies for land use within the municipality,</li>
<li class="fragment next">Zoning plans: where specific areas are zoned for different land use with detailed regulations</li>
<li class="fragment next">Building case: where the processing of building application is done.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="famke-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Famke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Combining the flood plain with the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) solves 2 fundamental problems, which?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Water levels on the mouth of a tributary do not necessarily depend on runoff or field characteristics, but being influenced by the main river</li>
<li class="fragment next">virtual DTM water divide lies beyond actual water divide</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="willemijn-ogg" class="slide level2">
<h2>Willemijn Ogg</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is a hydrologic correct DTM?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">A hydrologic correct DTM means the DTM has been corrected in a way the calculated flow paths follow the actual rivers and streams.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why isn’t is so important to study the effect of using regionally differentiated formulas for calculating the maximum water level rise in the hydrological model?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Due to the flat topography of the valley floor, the hydrological method is relatively insensitive to the exact water level rise. Inaccuracy in the calculated flood levels has little effect on the models result.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="helge" class="slide level2">
<h2>Helge</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>DTM – National 25x25m digital terrain was used in the mapping. What are the main limitation and what is the consequences?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Resolution and accuracy. The DTM is made from contours with 10m and 20m equidistance from base maps in scale of 1:50 000. The accuracy is one of the limitations, and the std. is between 4 and 6m. With the use of this coarse data, not only details will be lost, but also (relatively) larger slopes and flat terrain can be overseen by the data.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="helge-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Helge</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>The parameters used in the Hydrological method have inaccuracy. What are these?</strong></li>

</section><section id="vibeke" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the main hypothesis in the geomorphological, slope analysis and river network approach</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The main hypothesis is that flat areas in the vicinity of rivers were created in a process of sedimentation and thus prone to flooding. So by identifying the flat areas in the terrain, potensial flooding prone areas can be identified.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="vibeke-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Vibeke</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>In Finland, flood levels are calculated with the use of the Bernoulli’s and Mannings equation with standard river profiles. Why is this approach not applicable for use in Norway</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The variation in the Norwegian terrain makes their equation not applicable for mapping flood levels.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="torbjorn" class="slide level2">
<h2>Torbjorn</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>in Finland flood levels are calculated using Bernoulli’s and Manning’s equations with standard river profiles. Why couldn’t NVE do that in Norway?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">The answer the report provides is this: “Because of the variations in the Norwegian terrain, standard river profiles in Bernoulli’s and Manning’s equations can not be applied”. But I don’t understand why. Please explain, Florian</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the resolution of the DTM they used? Do they have a new one now and has that affected they methods they use?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">25x25 meters. The rest is a question to Florian.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>The revision in 2007, there was a need for a more precise and clarification of how the guide lines in the Planning and Building act could be implemented in the land use planning act. There was recommended to follow a stepwise procedure for assessing natural hazards. name the three steps and how hazards should be identified/treated?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Municipal plans; Potential hazards should be identified</li>
<li class="fragment next">Zoning plan; The actual hazards should be described, and risk quantified (RVA).</li>
<li class="fragment next">Building case; A satisfactory level of safety must be documented.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="kristine-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Routines that were incorporated to the hydrology method to improve the inaccuracy of the results. What are the routines?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Due to the inaccuracy of the terrain model, the results could locally be very wrong.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Water levels are not taken directly from the terrain model. These are first smoothed</li>
<li class="fragment next">Buffer distance per watershed introduces an error can result in wrong water level calculations. Watersheds that do not share a boarder can be treated at the same time. Watersheds that being at the same iteration, can have very short distance from each other.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="kristine-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Kristine</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Using a buffer, the watershed can be overlapping and there by provide wrong water level calculations. Hence, the use of buffers should be used with care. Calculating cross section watershed on the DTM the poor point of the rivers is used. In some cases, parts of the actual watershed do not drain to the river when the virtual terrain model is used. This results in areas where no flood level is calculated. By assigning the highest flood level from the neighbouring cells within the watershed, this error is corrected.</li>
<li class="fragment next">By using a sensitivity test were the maximum water level rise is changed, extremes are eliminated. Extremes in the extent of the flood plane in case of local inaccuracy in the DTM are then corrected using the extent of the flood plane from the sensitivity calculation plus 2 times the standard deviation.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="john-sverre" class="slide level2">
<h2>John Sverre</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why can the proposed model (the hydrological part of it, at least) give false inundation planes?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Because the virtual water divide used for calculating inundation is further removed from the river than the actual water divide.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why are not water levels at the mouth of a tributary not exclusively dependent on runoff?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Water levels can also fluctuate due to changing water levels in the main river.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="anna" class="slide level2">
<h2>Anna</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Why can the results of the report not be used as a flood inundation map?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Because the method used is not accurate enough. The Geomorphologic method works well in isolated areas, but in complex river systems the method does no longer work. The hydrological method works better but the parameters used in this method have their own inaccuracy.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="anna-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Anna</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Which different approaches were used during the hydrological method?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">Data from gauging stations, catchment characteristics, catchment area, comparable river in the same area. These four approaches were used with the assumption that the water level could be obtained without any hydrological or hydraulic calculations.</li>

<li class="fragment next"><strong>What is the Strahler river order?</strong></li>
<li class="fragment next">A system for ordering streams (and waterbodies) in a hierarchy, showing which rivers are tribunary and how they merge (their confluence points). The Strahler order is a “top-down” system where rivers “1” are the outermost tributaries. If two tributaries (at level “n”) join, the resulting stream is n+1.</li>
