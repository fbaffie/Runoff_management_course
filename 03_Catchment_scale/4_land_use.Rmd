## Deborahs comment
Butterflies and other animals used to pasture can be in trouble if a landscape of reforested. During the succession toward forest climax, the scrubs such as braken fern cover the land extensively and destroy specific pasture habitats.

> - 1-2%

> - **what is typical carbon content of forest soils?**
> - 10% (up to 30% in wetlands in Scandinavia)

> - **What about peat?**
> - more than 30%

## Soil carbon

> - **At the carbon capture conference, a forestry expert showed that the north side of a grass roof had accumulated soil over it's lifetime but no on the south side: why?**
> - The organic matter in the soil decomposes quicker when exposed to sunlight and higher temperatures. 
> - The annual rate of biomass production <= rate of decomposition

## Keyline

P.A. Yeomans - The Keyline plan:
"A Keyline is a level or sloping line extended in both directions from a certain point in a valley, called the "keypoint".
This marks or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its adjacent ridges. In one of these relationships, that above the Keyline, the valley will be narrower and steeper generally than the adjacent ridges on either side of it. In the second relationship, existing below the Keyline, the valley will be wider and flatter than its immediately adjacent ridges, or shoulders."

## Interesting idea, but this description is unclear!

## [Holistic management](https://holisticmanagement.org/)

Intensive rotational grazing with an adaptative plan: 
- animals are forced to eat stuff they like less
- controls unwanted plants
- can improve soil infiltration properties
- can improve root depth by stressing the grass more but less often
- can thus help sequester more carbon

Many of the examples that follow are inspired by the Permaculture movement: 

"Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system." (Bill Mollison)

## On vegetated buffer and mixed cropping

from http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-01-31/multifunctional-agriculture-a-new-paradigm-of-mixed-cropping/
"The ability of some perennial forage and bioenergy crops to tolerate wet conditions makes it feasible to design harvestable saturated buffers or seasonal wetlands in which nitrate that would otherwise reach surface waters, fertilizes a biomass crop lower on the landscape."

## Monbiot
[Chris Smaje on Monbiots "How did we get into this mess?"](http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-01/songs-of-the-uplands/). He focuses on food issues but general land use policies have an impact on food production so it does make sense

"In my review of George’s book How Did We Get Into This Mess I made the point that there’s a tension in it between the perspective of the indigene trying to figure out how to make a living from the land, and that of the rational-bureaucratic planner trying to figure out how to deliver services to the existing population."

## Europe

An interesting report linking land management issues to flooding, and how experimental and modelling studies can help: [impact of upland land management on flood risk](http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/5890/1/ur16_impacts_upland_land_management_wp2_2_v1_0.pdf)

[Linking hydrological modelling, catchment management and land use](http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/5890/1/ur16_impacts_upland_land_management_wp2_2_v1_0.pdf)

Conclusions are interesting to show results of hydrological modelling that can be use for policy-making: "Both experimental and modelling studies from this site illustrate the potential significance of
small-scale land management changes for reducing hillslope runoff peaks: this poses a challenge
to scientists, land managers and policy makers. How can we best establish and optimise strategies for
mitigation of flood peaks, given other landscape objectives such as economically viable farming,
ecological needs, legislative requirements and leisure utilisation? "

“I think that to some extent both for me and Bill Mollison, when we met we were at a point, for slightly different reasons, we’d both come to the conclusion that we didn’t want to fight against the world we didn’t want, but wanted to just actively create the world we do want.”

<!--
## Forests and water quality
The concept of nature for water takes into account the role of terrestrial ecosystems in enhancing water yields and water quality. For instance, the Lange Erlen forested area in Switzerland is flooded a dozen days a month with water from the Rhine to allow forest soil to filter the water to improve its quality and recharge the groundwater of the nearby city of Basel. "

## Forests and water quantity
- Water use by forests depends on climate, forest and soil type...
- Forest typically have: high ET, lower surface runoff and groundwater recharge
- forests reduce dry-season flows as much as or more than they reduce annual water yields. 
- in degraded agricultural catchments the extra infiltration associated with afforested land might outweigh the extra evaporation loss from forests, resulting in increased rather than reduced dry-season flows – but this has rarely been seen.

cloud forests are likely to increase water, some old natural forests may also increase flow, and young forests and plantations are likely to decrease flow. Individual cases need to be assessed, depending on soil, climate, forest types and age, and management regime.

## Forests and flooding
- Reduction of downstream flooding by floodplain forest, where hydraulic roughness (the combination of all elements that may cause flow resistance, such as forest litter, dead wood, twigs and tree trunks) may slow down flood flows.
- Natural forests and well-managed plantations can protect drinking-water supplies. 
- Managed forests usually have low input of nutrients, pesticides and other chemicals
- Forests planted in agricultural and urban areas can reduce pollutants, especially when located on runoff pathways or in riparian zones

## Forests and erosion
- Forests protect soils and reduce erosion rates and sediment delivery to rivers.
- Forestry operations may increase sediment losses, but best management practices can control this risk. 
- Planting forest on erosion-prone soils and runoff pathways can reduce and intercept sediment.

## Forests and climate change
- Global climate models predict marked changes in seasonal snowfall, rainfall and evaporation in many parts of the world. 
- In the context of these changes the influence of forests on water quantity and quality may be negative or positive. 
- Where large-scale forest planting is contemplated for climate change mitigation, it is essential to ensure that it will not accentuate water shortages. 
- Shade provided by riparian forests may help reduce thermal stress to aquatic life as climate warming intensifies.

## Forests and energy
Fast-growing forest crops have potential for high water demand which can lead to reduced water yields. The local trade-off between energy generation opportunities and water impacts may be a key issue in regions where climate change threatens water resources.

## Importance of those processes for water resources
- Forestation has been substantial in Norway since XXX. It may increase in the future with climate change.
- Impact on the quantity and quality of surface waters and groundwater.
- In all climates, rural land use can have a significant impact on water resources 

## Forests and water resources
From http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1598e/a1598e02.htm

- Relationship between forests and water is difficult but not straighforward

- At the macro scale, natural processes in the upper watershed are more important than land management practices in the development of large floods. 
- Does deforestation in the Himalayas causes bigger floods in the lowlands?
- Strong scientific evidence against: large-scale floods combination of simultaneous discharge peaks of the large rivers, heavy rainfall, high groundwater tables, disappearance of storage areas in the lowlands (Hofer and Messerli, 2006).

Good reasons for reforesting watersheds:
- reducing soil loss
- keeping sediments out of streams
- maintain wildlife habitat 

- Flood risk reduction or even control is not necessarily one of them

- Reforestation to prevent or reduce floods is effective only at a local scale of a few hundred hectares. 
- The complex relationships between forests and water in large river basins continue to be debated (see CIFOR, 2007), and it is clear that more work is needed for full understanding of these relationships."
