<h2>Quotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” LEONARDO DA VINCI</li>
<li>“Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles: when things always behave the same, users don’t have to worry about what will happen. Instead, they know what will happen based on earlier experience.” JAKOB NIELSEN</li>
<li>“If you find an element of your interface requires instructions, then you need to redesign it.” DAN RUBIN</li>
<li>“A good designer finds an elegant way to put everything you need on a page. A great designer convinces you half that shit is unnecessary.” MIKE MONTEIRO</li>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told, “Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” STEVE JOBS</li>
<li>“If the users can’t find it, the function’s not there.” HUMAN FACTORS INTERNATIONAL</li>
<li>“A good design solves a problem. A bad design creates many.” SAMADARA GINIGE</li>

<h2>Resilience is important for climate change</h2>
<p>Resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to respond to a perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly</p>
<p>Longer version from Valeria’s lecture:</p>
<p>“The capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.”</p>
</section><section id="importance-of-history" class="slide level2">
<h2>Importance of history</h2>
<p>Look at ancien designs</p>
<p>How and why were they made?</p>
<p>Understand the old constraints to understand their limitations or ingenuities</p>
<p>Example: transport systems, commercial practices, agricultural tools and methods</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y4854E/y4854e08.htm#TopOfPage">The issue of technology vis-à-vis management</a></h2>
<p>The online book from the FAO “The irrigation challenge” includes an interesting discussion on the causes of poor performance in canal and irrigation systems: is it management and institutional problems or technical design problems?</p>
<p>“What are the causes of deficiencies in designing irrigation systems? Most civil engineers are well trained in structural engineering and construction techniques but not in the practical and theoretical aspects of unsteady flow hydraulics that are the norm in most irrigation systems. They are also unfamiliar with the constraints of the end user. Appropriate irrigation design and management is much more complicated than most engineers, administrators and donors assume.”</p>
<!--
"Second, designers are rarely confronted with the consequences of how their designs function once they are installed.
Third, many irrigation agencies cling to outdated design standards and often resist changes by external experts. Most consulting firms have no contractual motivation and no financial incentives to introduce new concepts."

Operational failures of irrigation systems are not dramatic and are not widely publicized. Operation staff can operate canal for a while by infringing on freeboard and farmers are adjusting to the poor delivery by sinking wells or building reservoirs.

Many failures and problems are caused by a design approach that pays insufficient attention to operational aspects. The point is that if hydraulic systems were simple to operate to attain good water delivery service, safety and efficiency, then management and institutional problems may disappear. Many management and institutional problems are self-inflicted wounds that could be minimized or eliminated with proper designs and operational instructions (Burt, 1999).

A frequently heard argument is that modernization is too costly and too sophisticated. In modern schemes, irrigation is provided as a service to users that should be as efficient and convenient as possible. Modernization is a thought process that starts with the definition of a proper operational plan. The selection of water control equipment is then done in the light of the operational objectives and the requirements of the farming systems.

In most cases, proper hydraulic design and simple automation techniques can make significant improvements. A good design, even with sophisticated devices, results in simple rules of operation at all levels in canal systems."

<!--
"The Ugly: Disregarding Site Conditions
Occasionally, regulators, or even designers, are led to believe that implementing certain stormwater controls is the “silver bullet” that can address the project’s stormwater quality and control requirements. Permeable pavement systems, green pavement systems, rain gardens, bioswales, and various others are commonly used, but these systems shouldn’t be thrown into a design haphazardly. Some projects are ideal candidates for implementation of sustainable design elements. They are generally well-drained, permeable soils, in favorable climates. Other projects are more challenging in terms of sustainability due to impermeable and moisture-sensitive soils and prolonged freezing temperatures and limited frost depth. The specific site conditions, including geology, hydrology, climate, and function of the facility need to be considered before selection of the final systems."

"Bioswales can fail because they are underdrained so extensively that they provide little filtering or retention causing the vegetation in them to die before being able to establish itself. To prevent that, the design of bioswales should take into account soil types and permeability, groundwater levels, and contributory drainage levels, so they will be fully integrated into their surroundings. Rain gardens can become washed out and transport organic-laden materials into the storm systems because the plantings don’t have sufficient root structure to withstand the higher rain events, or the design didn’t consider it. To prevent that, the design needs to be based on the appropriate amount of flow, and the rain gardens need regular maintenance. Permeable pavement systems fail if they so efficiently collect rainwater and discharge it to the storm network that they function more like a standard impervious pavement system. An appropriately designed system will address water treatment concerns, minimize the impact of the development on the environment, and support a functional, beautiful facility. 

As with any sustainable design, the intent of the requirements should be upheld. The objective shouldn’t be simply obtaining the LEED certification, but rather developing an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly facility. Design professionals need to be both conscientious about designing systems based on the specific site characteristics and also take responsibility for assisting their clients in setting up appropriate operational and maintenance procedures."

Summary of [Assessing the effectiveness of delivering multifunctional sustainable drainage](http://www.ciwem.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/A-Place-for-SuDS.pdf)

"Our analysis, underpinned by the
findings from the survey, provides a
clear indication that:
1. At the majority of sites, the costs
and particularly the benefits of
implementing SuDS, are not being
assessed.
2. Physical site constraints are cited
frequently as reasons to ‘opt-out’ of
delivering SuDS in new housing and
commercial developments, when the
range of options available means
this is commonly unjustified.
3. In many areas planning authorities
do not have the capacity to judge
the merits of applications properly,
leading to more opt-outs than
necessary on the grounds of
price and practicality as many go
unchallenged.
4. Where SuDS have been delivered,
they often miss opportunities to
provide multiple benefits as they
follow the very narrow non-statutory
standards that exist presently.
5. The adoption and future
maintenance of SuDS are the
greatest barriers to be resolved."

"Sustainable drainage mimics natural
processes and reduces flooding by
managing rainfall close to its source
and wherever possible at, or near
the surface. By building in permeable
paving, channels, green roofs, swales,
soakaways or ponds, sustainable
drainage becomes a “city circulatory
system”, slowing, storing and treating
water that could cause damage
(figure 1). Well-designed SuDS should
incorporate the four elements of water
quantity, water quality, amenity and
biodiversity wherever possible."

"The use of SuDS is not limited by
the ability of soil to infiltrate (for
example on clay sites), as all SuDS
can be designed to attenuate
(or hold back water) as well as
infiltrate. The use of attenuation is
standard practice, with infiltration
being seen as a bonus."

"We believe that failure to consider
SuDS from the very start of a
development’s design is a significant
barrier to efficient delivery efficient
delivery. There is a real opportunity
to address this through stronger
policy and standards"

"This evidence suggests that capital
and maintenance cost differences
are usually marginal, and from
anecdotal evidence in the survey,
it was found that SuDS should cost
less than conventional drainage if
schemes are well-designed"

"The cost of SuDS—perceived or
real—is likely to remain a source of
debate. Whilst the wider benefits
of SuDS remain largely unpriced,
objective assessment of the viability
of schemes will remain difficult.
If we are to build climate resilient
developments, we must address
these costs and benefits more
carefully."

"At the heart of the problem in England
and Wales is the automatic right
to connect surface water run-off in
new developments to existing sewer
systems, reducing the need for
developers to consider implementing
SuDS. This right to connect was
established in Section 106 of the
Water Industry Act 1991³⁵ 25 years
ago, during which time pressures on
drainage infrastructure have increased
significantly. Water and sewerage
companies are not statutory consultees
for new developments, which hampers
their involvement in issues relating
to water quality and surface water
management systems."

"We consider that the lack of
clarity regarding the adoption
and allocation of maintenance
responsibilities of SuDS is arguably
the greatest single barrier to
widespread implementation.
Resolving this should be an urgent
priority for the Government."

"New standards should be produced
with more considered detail and
robustness on priorities to assist
the Lead Local Flood Authority in
promoting the uptake of high quality
SuDS systems and provide greater
confidence for the adopter."

## Having a basin only designed for big events makes it harder to integrate

Interesting example with Figure 3:

"Somerset, a missed opportunity for SuDS. Photo courtesy of Peter Melville
Shreeve. The ‘lake’ on this housing estate of 200 homes is always empty and unsightly.
The lake will only fill during a one in 100-year storm event. This could easily have been
designed with higher amenity value, as useable space, but the plans already had decided
on the pond before drainage consultants were engaged on the design."

## Putting a $ figure on improvements to life quality / social benefits is difficult

## Report findings

"1. At the majority of sites, the costs
and particularly the benefits of
implementing SuDS are not being
assessed.
2. Physical site constraints are cited
frequently as reasons to ‘opt-out’ of
delivering SuDS in new housing and
commercial developments, when the
range of options available means
this is commonly unjustified.
3. In many areas planning authorities
do not have the capacity to judge
the merits of applications properly,
leading to more opt-outs than
necessary on the grounds of
price and practicality as many go
unchallenged.
4. Where SuDS have been delivered,
they often miss opportunities to
provide multiple benefits as they
follow the very narrow official
standards that exist presently.
5. The adoption and future
maintenance of SuDS are the
greatest barrier that needs resolving. "

## Knowledge gaps

"1. The scale and extent of SuDS
deployment and monitoring across
the country.
2. The quality of SuDS delivery,
relating to the non-statutory
SuDS standards, designing to an
adoptable standard and other
recognised benefits like water
quality, biodiversity and amenity.
3. The effectiveness of planning policy
in driving the delivery, quality and
adoption of SuDS.
4. The capacity of local planning
officers and Lead Local Flood
Authorities to assess the merits of
SuDS proposals and the viability of
applications.
5. The impact of the ten home
threshold excluding minor
developments from requiring SuDS.
6. Improved recording and reporting
of SuDS implementation. "

## Policy proposals

"1. Discharge of surface water to the
sewer system should be conditional
on the inclusion first of high-quality
SuDS in new developments.
2. A clear decision must be taken
with regard to the adoption
and allocation of maintenance
responsibilities for SuDS. This
should have a clear and established
mechanism for raising funds to
ensure the continued effective
maintenance and eventual
replacement of all SuDS they adopt.
3. New standards are developed aimed
at optimising opportunity to achieve
amenity, biodiversity and water
quality benefits as well as flood risk
reduction. These should reflect the
needs of the adopting authority so
that they can set out an approval
process and adopt with confidence.
4. The Government should undertake
a follow up review of the barriers
to retrofitting SuDS in existing
developments and make proposals
on how retrofitting might be
incentivised. "
