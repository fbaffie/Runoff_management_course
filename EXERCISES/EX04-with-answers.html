<h2>Street SW infiltration</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Let’s say his system handles 5m of road width with a 1m wide infiltration strip</li>
<li class="fragment next">So 5<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> of road runoff + 1<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> of infiltration strip needs to infiltrate in 1<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">What is the required infiltration rate to avoid ponding during a 5min 10-year precipitation event (100<span class="math inline">\(l/s\)</span> per Ha)</li>
<li class="fragment next">By infiltration rate, I mean the vertical velocity at which water will infiltrate into the soil (in <span class="math inline">\(m/s\)</span>). You do not need to relate it to hydraulic conductivity (see <a href="https://fbaffie.github.io/Runoff_management_course/01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_2.html#hortons-empirical-equation-for-infiltration">there</a> for the dynamic behaviour of infiltration rate in reality)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="street-sw-infiltration-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Street SW infiltration</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">We use the rational formula for the road runoff</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(Q = C*i*A = 0.9*i*A\)</span> we use 0.9 as arunoff coefficient. You could also use 1 if you neglect the small retention and infiltration properties of the asphalt.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Unit conversion: 100l/Ha of precipitation intensity is <span class="math inline">\(0.1m3/s\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(10000m^2\)</span> (1 Ha is <span class="math inline">\(100*100m\)</span>)</li>
<li class="fragment next">So for <span class="math inline">\(5m^2\)</span> of road <span class="math inline">\(Q = C*i*A = 0.9*0.5/10000 = 4.5*10^{-5} m3/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">In addition, <span class="math inline">\(Q = i*A = 0.1*1/10000 = 1*10^{-5} m3/s\)</span> of rain fall onto the infiltrationa area</li>
<li class="fragment next">So in total, for an infiltration area of 1m2, we required an infiltration rate of <span class="math inline">\(4.5*10^{-5}+1*10^{-5} = 5.5*10^{-5} m/s\)</span></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="amount-of-precipitation-to-fill-up-the-tank" class="slide level2">
<h2>Amount of precipitation to fill up the tank</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">We assume <span class="math inline">\(80m^2\)</span> of total roof area. The total storage volume is 8000 liters</li>
<li class="fragment next">How much precipitation is required to fill up the tanks?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="amount-of-precipitation-to-fill-up-the-tank-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Amount of precipitation to fill up the tank</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">1mm of rain is the equivalent of 1<span class="math inline">\(l/m^2\)</span>. So 1<span class="math inline">\(mm\)</span> of rain gives him 80<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> = 0.08<span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">So his tanks will need 8000/80 = 100<span class="math inline">\(mm\)</span> of rain to fill up</li>
<li class="fragment next">Which precipitation event does it correspond to in the Oppstryn IVF?</li>
<li class="fragment next">A 200-year 24h long precipitation event</li>
<li class="fragment next">Considering that it rains approx 300mm/year in Tucson, he can store a lot of the year’s precipitation</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="infiltration-rate-required-if-the-tank-overflows" class="slide level2">
<h2>Infiltration rate required if the tank overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Assume that his tanks are already full when a 5min 10-year precipitation event happens (100<span class="math inline">\(l/s\)</span> per Ha)</li>
<li class="fragment next">Assume that his infiltration mulch bed is 20m2 in area</li>
<li class="fragment next">Which infiltration rate is required to avoid ponding in the infiltration area?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="infiltration-rate-required-if-the-tank-overflows-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Infiltration rate required if the tank overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">If we take a runoff coefficient of 1 for the roofs, the total area contributing precipitation to the infiltration bed is 80m2 of roof + 20m2 of infiltration bed.</li>
<li class="fragment next">So a precipitation intensity of 0.1m3/s for 10000m2 (100l/s per Ha) makes <span class="math inline">\(0.1*100/10000 = 10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span> of inflow into the infiltration area</li>
<li class="fragment next">A 20m2 infiltration area will therefore require an infiltration rate of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3}/20 = 5*10^{-5} m/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">This is consistent with our estimate of the infiltration capacity required for the road-side strip. His setup seems to be coherently sized.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="storage-volume-in-mulch-bed" class="slide level2">
<h2>Storage volume in mulch bed</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Assume that the infiltration area has the previously calculated infiltration capacity: <span class="math inline">\(5*10^{-5}\)</span> m/s</li>
<li class="fragment next">How much ponding storage (height of the paddle in the mulch bed) is needed to handle a 3min 100-year precipitation event (200l/s per Ha)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="storage-volume-in-mulch-bed-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Storage volume in mulch bed</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Intensity has doubled, so inflow has doubled: <span class="math inline">\(2*10^{-3}\)</span> m3/s of inflow into the infiltration area</li>
<li class="fragment next">Based on the previous exercise, the extra flow (above <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span>) is what the infiltration rate cannot handle: <span class="math inline">\(2*10^{-3}-10^{-3} = 10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">So during 3 min, the accumulated volume that could not infiltrate is: <span class="math inline">\(3*60*10^{-3}= 180*10^{-3}=0.180 m^{3}\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">Spread over 20<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>, this makes a ponding height of: <span class="math inline">\(0.180/20 = 0.009m = 9mm\)</span></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="how-much-flow-can-the-wet-system-convey-before-the-higher-roof-overflows" class="slide level2">
<h2>How much flow can the wet system convey before the higher roof overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">There is a 20<span class="math inline">\(cm\)</span> height difference between end gutters of the wet system</li>

<h2>How much flow can the wet system convey before the higher roof overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Important assumptions to discuss</strong>:</li>
<li class="fragment next">This exercise assumes no frictional losses and that both gutters acts as small reservoirs</li>
<li class="fragment next">A first approximation is say that the velocity of water in the upper gutter is 0. This makes for an easy application of Bernouilli’s Law.</li>
<li class="fragment next">How could we take into account friction?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="how-much-flow-can-the-tank-inlet-convey-before-the-filter-overflows" class="slide level2">
<h2>How much flow can the tank inlet convey before the filter overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><a href="./1_fluid_dynamics.html#exercise-flow-out-of-a-reservoir">There</a>, we calculated the flow out of a reservoir in very similar conditions. In this case, the reservoirs are the gutters.</li>
<li class="fragment next">This gives us a velocity of <span class="math inline">\(v= (2gd)^{1/2} = 2m/s\)</span> for water going through the wet system. We need to multiply it by the cross-sectional area of the pipe to get the flow rate:</li>
<li class="fragment next">Assuming a 10cm wide pipe: <span class="math inline">\(Q=2*0.05^2 \pi = 0.0157 m^3/s\)</span></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="time-to-empty-the-tank-through-a-10mm-pipe" class="slide level2">
<h2>Time to empty the tank through a 10mm pipe</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Imagine that the water level of the full tank is 2m higher than the r=10mm irrigation hose. The cross-sectional area of the tank is <span class="math inline">\(A = 2m^2\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">How long would it take to empty the water tank through this hose?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="time-to-empty-the-tank-through-a-10mm-pipe-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Time to empty the tank through a 10mm pipe</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">As we saw in the previous example, the velocity out of the irrigation hose: <span class="math inline">\(v(t)= (2gh(t))^{1/2}\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">Applying the conservation of mass per increment of time dt:</li>
<li class="fragment next">Flow out of the irrigation hose = A*dh/dt = the area of the tank x small drop in water level (dh) per increment of time (dt)</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\((2gh(t))^{1/2} * r^2* \pi = A*dh/dt\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">The trick now is to separate <span class="math inline">\(dh\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>, to have only <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dh\)</span> on one side</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="time-to-empty-the-tank-through-a-10mm-pipe-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Time to empty the tank through a 10mm pipe</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(dt= C*h(t)^{-1/2}*dh\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(C=A/(r^2* \pi * (2g)^{1/2})\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">This way, we can easily integrate both sides of the equation between <span class="math inline">\(t_{end} \ and \ t_0\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(t_{end}-t_0 = 2*C*(h_{top}^{1/2}-h_{bottom}^{1/2})\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(h_{bottom}\)</span> is our reference elevation so it is nul. This yields:</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(t_{end}= 2*C*h_{top}^{1/2} = 2*2/(1.4*10^{-3})*2^{1/2} = 4028 s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">So 1.12 hours required to empty the reservoir</li>
<li class="fragment next">You could do the same to see how long it would take the first flush system to empty through a small hose as discussed earlier to avoid frost issues.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="flow-out-of-a-water-filter" class="slide level2">
<h2>Flow out of a water filter</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Imagine a water filter with charcoal (5cm length of porous media) that has a hydraulic conductivity of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-4}\)</span> m/s. Which cross sectional area should the filter have to fill up 1 L in 5 seconds when the tank is full?</li>
<li class="fragment next">We have 2<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of head difference to push water through the 5<span class="math inline">\(cm\)</span> filter.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="flow-out-of-a-water-filter-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Flow out of a water filter</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">We apply Darcy’s Law in a very similar way to his <a href="../01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_2.html#darcys-experiment">experiment</a></li>
<li class="fragment next">Flow per unit area = hydraulic conductivity * hydraulic gradient. With 2m of head in the tank, and 0.05m of porous material, the hydraulic gradient is 2/0.05 and:</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(q=2/0.05*K = 2/0.05*10^{-4} = 0.004 m^3/s/m^2\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">We need <span class="math inline">\(Q = 1/5 = 0.2 l/s = 0.2*10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">We use the relationship <span class="math inline">\(Q= q*A\)</span> to calculate the required cross-sectional area</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(A= Q/q = 0.2*10^{-3}/0.004 = 0.05m^2 = 500cm^2\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">This is unrealistic so this filter idea could only be considered for example with 1cm thickness of porous media with a hydraulic conductivity of <span class="math inline">\(K=10^{-3}\)</span> m/s</li>
<li class="fragment next">In this case, the cross section becomes reasonable: <span class="math inline">\(A = 10cm^2\)</span></li>
