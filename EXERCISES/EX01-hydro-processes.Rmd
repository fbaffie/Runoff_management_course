## Hydrological processes

In this exercise session we will practice concepts covered in class:
- Infiltration
- Groundwater flow
- Evaporation
- Snowmelt and glacier melt

Check this for inspiration

## Conductivity of "Dyna Sand" sand filters
I found [there](https://www.parkson.com/sites/default/files/documents/document-dynasand-ecowash-filter-full-scale-test-report-463.pdf) that the loading rate of the filters was 3.5gpm/SqFt

> - **Check whether this makes sense, considering what you heard on Wednesday!**
> - **The whole thing is done here without calculator with "useful" approximations!** 
> - The reservoir was 1000$m3$ and represented 6h max of daily consumption
> - So daily consumption: 4000m3
> - The sand filters need to be able to produce the daily consumption in 24h!

## Conductivity of "Dyna Sand" sand filters
> - **Calculate the required flow per minute**
> - 4000 / 60x24 = 4000 / 1440 -> 4000 / 1600 (easier) = 2.5$m^3/min$
> - **Calculate the required surface for this flow**
> - 3.5$gpm/SqFt$ -> 3.5x4 = 14 $l/min/sqft$ -> 14x10 $l/min/m^2$ = 0.14 $m^3/min/m^2$
> - Recapitulation: 2.5$m^3/min$ is required and the sand filter has a capacity of 0.14 $m^3/min/m^2$
> - So 15-20$m^2$ required: 5 filters of 3-4$m^2$
> - Makes sense!

## Conductivity of "Dyna Sand" sand filters
> - **The input hydraulic head was 10 bars, the sand thickness was 4m and the free water surface was about 1m higher (5m higher than the base of the filter). Calculate the hydraulic conductivity of the sand**
> - 10 bars makes 100m of head at the inlet
> - The free flowing water surface at the top of the filter is 5m higher, so 5m head in reference to the base of the filter
> - So hydraulic head gradient across the sand filter: 95 / 4 -> 24
> - using Darcy's Law: $q=-k \nabla{\phi}$
> - $K*24 = 0.14m^3/min/m^2$ -> $K = \frac{2.3*10^{-3}}{24} = 10^{-4} m/s$ 
> - Makes sense!

## [Steady flow in an unconfined aquifer](http://www.geo.citg.tudelft.nl/~uffink/syllabusCT3320/part1/6.1/6.1.html)

> - **Most aquifers are thin and quite flat. Which flow direction can we neglect?**
> - We can neglect vertical flow. Groundwater is hydrostatic (vertical equipotential lines)
> - Groundwater discharge is proportional to the depth of the aquifer
> - This is the Dupuit–Forchheimer assumption

## Find Q as a function of $K$, L, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$

> 1. **Express Q as a function of h and q (flow per unit area)**
> 1. **Use the conservation of mass across each $dx$ slice of aquifer**
> 1. **With the reference level as the base of the aquifer ($\phi = h$), write Darcy's Law**
> 1. **Combine 2 and 3**
> 1. **We assume that *K* is uniform, integrate, and express $h^2$ and $h$ as a function of x, L, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$**
> 1. **Using steps 1 and 3, we want to express $Q$ without $x$**
> 1. Finally we have: $Q = -K\frac{(\phi_2^2-\phi_1^2)}{2L}$


# Groundwater recession

## Modelling recession dynamics

$Q = Q_{0} * e^{-ct}$

$c$ is the recession constant.

Groundwater recession would be a function of some (average) measure of hydraulic head:

$Q = f(h(t))$

If the aquifer is 1m wide, has a length L, and a storativity or specific yield S, then we can write:

$SL \frac{dh}{dt} = -q_r = -f(h(t))$

Proportionality between h and qr:

$q_r = cSLh(t)$

and by substituting we get

$\frac{dh}{dt} = -ch$

which then integrated gives:*

$h = h_0 * e^{-ct}$

where h0 is the average hydraulic head at the initial time.
Then from the proportionality relation we have:

$q_r = cSL * h_0 * e^{-ct}$

or 

$Q_r = Q_{r0} * e^{-ct}$

So the use of the first equation implies that the groundwater reservoir behaves as a linear reservoir, the GW outflow is proportional the amount of water stored.

This tool can be usefull to estimate flow throughout a dry season.

> - **From this graph, what can you tell about the relationship between electrical conductivity and streamflow?**
> - There is an inverse proportionality which seems to depend on the season and the discharge.

## Initial data and modelling results

## Two component mixing model
> - **Write the water balance to express $Q(t)$, the total discharge at time t, as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, the groundwater exfiltration and $Q_{gl}(t)$, the glacier melt contribution (we neglect rain and evapotranspiration)**
> - $Q(t) = Q_{gw}(t) + Q_{gl}(t)$
> - **Write the solute mass balance to express $Q(t) EC(t)$ (the mass of solutes exiting the catchment per second) as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $Q_{gl}(t)$ as well as $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$, which are respectively the constant electrical conductivity values for groundwater and glacier melt. EC is a proxy for the concentration of solutes in water.**
> - $Q(t) * EC(t) = Q_{gw}(t)*EC_{gw} + Q_{gl}(t)*EC_{gl}$

## Total discharge as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$

> - **By substituting $Q_{gl}(t)$ in one of the previous equations, express $Q(t)$ as a function of $Q_{gw}(t)$, $EC(t)$ and the constants $EC_{gw}$ and $EC_{gl}$**
> - $Q(t) = \frac{Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw} - EC_{gl})}{EC(t) - EC_{gl}}$


## Modelled baseflow recession

<!--
> - $Q(t)=Q_{gw}(t)*(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})/(EC(t)−EC_{gl})$
$Q(t) = \frac{(EC_{gw}−EC_{gl})Q_{gw}(t)}{EC(t)−EC_{gl}}$

## GW exfiltration as a function of groundwater level
\[Q_{gw}(t) = V_{slow}(t)*T_{slow} + V_{fast}(t) T_{fast}\]
-->

<!--
## Recession discharge
\[Q_{recession}(t) = Q_{meas}(t_{end})*e^{\frac{t_{end} − t}{T_{slow}}}\]
-->

<!--
## Groundwater storage as a function of field GW measurements
\[L_{integral}(t) = L_{integral}(t − 1t) + P_n i+1 L_i(t)−L_i(t−1t) n \]
with $L_{integral}(t_{end}) = L_{residual}$


##  Total groundwater flow as a function of field GW measurements
\[Q_{gw}(t) = baseflow_{max} + A_{fast} × L_{integral}(t) × \Phi * T_{fast}\]


## Benchmark efficiency
\[E = 1 − P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{mod}(t))^2 P_t (Q_{meas}(t) − Q_{bench}(t))^2\]

## Verifying $A_{slow}$ with snowmelt recharge
\[V_{slow}(t) = V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t}) + (R(t) − \frac{V_{slow}(t−\Delta{t})}{T_{slow}})* \Delta{t}\]
-->

## Mass balance verification for the infiltration rate

> - **Write the infiltration rate as a function of the storage volume and the exfiltration rate $Q_{gw}$**
> - We neglect evapotranspiration and recharge from rain 
> - $Q_{inf}(t) = dV(t)dt + Q_{gw}(t)$

## Discussion

Discuss the pros and cons of this approach.

In which cases could it work better?

# Modelling snowmelt

## Program you own model!

Follow instruction of [exercise 6: Snow model](http://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/h2k/Services/HBV-Model/Exercise-6.html) provided by Universy of Zürich

## Steps

Load the data into R

Name model parameters and initialize modelled variables

Make a "for" loop to run the model


## Good of fit metrics

Discuss different ways to assess the quality of your model.

How might different objective functions be used in specific contexts?

Add a goodness of fit measure to your routine and optimize the model according to this metric.


# Extras

## The Sogndalselvi catchment

Use nevina.no to define the catchment and automatically fetch its properties.

Provide a short description of the catchment from a hydrological perspective.

Based on the hydrological ad meteorological data available on xgeo.no, try to understand the main components of the hydrological cycle.

What are inherent difficulties linked to the available data?

Which additional measurements would be required to better close the balance of the hydrological cycle?

## Estimating yearly averages

Download data for several years.

Calculate mean, median and extreme flow values for each year.

You can programm it as a parametrized function in order to take into account yearly variability.

Do a box plot on annual discharge statistics in Sogndal.

## Calculating the response to a rain event

## Estimating the recession behavior during dry periods

Calibrating a recession curve.

## Prepare potential evapotranspiration series

Use the method of your choice to compute daily potential evapotraspiration.

Try energy balance calculations for potential evapotranspiration. See Elements of physical hydrology.

AirGR can also calculate it with the Oudin’s formula. The function is `Edaily_Oudin()`
