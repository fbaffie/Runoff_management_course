## Hydrological processes

In this exercise session we will practice concepts covered in class:
- Infiltration
- Groundwater flow
- Evaporation
- Snowmelt and glacier melt

Check this for inspiration

## Conductivity of "Dyna Sand" sand filters
I found [there](https://www.parkson.com/sites/default/files/documents/document-dynasand-ecowash-filter-full-scale-test-report-463.pdf) that the loading rate of the filters was 3.5gpm/SqFt

> - **Check whether this makes sense, considering what you heard on Wednesday!**
> - **The whole thing is done here without calculator with "useful" approximations!** 
> - The reservoir was 1000$m3$ and represented 6h max of daily consumption
> - So daily consumption: 4000m3
> - The sand filters need to be able to produce the daily consumption in 24h!

## Conductivity of "Dyna Sand" sand filters
> - **Calculate the required flow per minute**
> - 4000 / 60x24 = 4000 / 1440 -> 4000 / 1600 (easier) = 2.5$m^3/min$
> - **Calculate the required surface for this flow**
> - 3.5$gpm/SqFt$ -> 3.5x4 = 14 $l/min/sqft$ -> 14x10 $l/min/m^2$ = 0.14 $m^3/min/m^2$
> - Recapitulation: 2.5$m^3/min$ is required and the sand filter has a capacity of 0.14 $m^3/min/m^2$
> - So 15-20$m^2$ required: 5 filters of 3-4$m^2$
> - Makes sense!

## Conductivity of "Dyna Sand" sand filters
> - **The input hydraulic head was 10 bars, the sand thickness was 4m and the free water surface was about 1m higher (5m higher than the base of the filter). Calculate the hydraulic conductivity of the sand**
> - 10 bars makes 100m of head at the inlet
> - The free flowing water surface at the top of the filter is 5m higher, so 5m head in reference to the base of the filter
> - So hydraulic head gradient across the sand filter: 95 / 4 -> 24
> - using Darcy's Law: $q=-k \nabla{\phi}$
> - $K*24 = 0.14m^3/min/m^2$ -> $K = \frac{2.3*10^{-3}}{24} = 10^{-4} m/s$ 
> - Makes sense!

## [Steady flow in an unconfined aquifer](http://www.geo.citg.tudelft.nl/~uffink/syllabusCT3320/part1/6.1/6.1.html)

> - **Most aquifers are thin and quite flat. Which flow direction can we neglect?**
> - We can neglect vertical flow. Groundwater is hydrostatic (vertical equipotential lines)
> - Groundwater discharge is proportional to the depth of the aquifer
> - This is the Dupuit–Forchheimer assumption

## Find Q as a function of $K$, L, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$

> 1. **Express Q as a function of h and q (flow per unit area)**
> 1. **Use the conservation of mass across each $dx$ slice of aquifer**
> 1. **With the reference level as the base of the aquifer ($\phi = h$), write Darcy's Law**
> 1. **Combine 2 and 3**
> 1. **We assume that *K* is uniform, integrate, and express $h^2$ and $h$ as a function of x, L, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$**
> 1. **Using steps 1 and 3, we want to express $Q$ without $x$**
> 1. Finally we have: $Q = -K\frac{(\phi_2^2-\phi_1^2)}{2L}$


## Conceptual modelling of surface / groundwater interactions

Copy here my phd example


## Case study: Sogndal's valley


## Catchment properties

Use Nevina

## Estimating yearly averages

Estimate the average annual discharge in Sogndal.
You can programm it as a parametrized function in order to take into account yearly variability.


## Calculating the response to a melt event

Setting up a temperature-index melt model

## Calculating the response to a rain event



## Estimating the recession behavior during dry periods

Calibrating a recession curve.

## Prepare potential evapotranspiration series

Use the method of your choice to compute daily potential evapotraspiration.

Try energy balance calculations for potential evapotranspiration. See Elements of physical hydrology.

AirGR can also calculate it with the Oudin’s formula. The function is `Edaily_Oudin()`


## Irrigation exercise

Good exercise page 255, elements of physical hydrology

## Flood frequency analysis

Use the fitdistrib package to fit some data from the Sogndal valley

Retrieve historical discharge data in Sogndal.
Create a dataset of annual maximum.

Find out about the methodology to compute IVF curves and dio them for Sogndal.
