## Hydrological processes

In this exercise session we will practice concepts covered in class:
- Infiltration
- Groundwater flow
- Evaporation
- Snowmelt and glacier melt

Check this for inspiration


## Flow through the sand filters

Copy here the exercise of the course?

## steady flow in an unconfined aquifer

Copy here the exercise of the course?

## Conceptual modelling of surface / groundwater interactions

Copy here my phd example


## Case study: Sogndal's valley


## Catchment properties

Use Nevina

## Estimating yearly averages

Estimate the average annual discharge in Sogndal.
You can programm it as a parametrized function in order to take into account yearly variability.


## Calculating the response to a melt event

Setting up a temperature-index melt model

## Calculating the response to a rain event



## Estimating the recession behavior during dry periods

Calibrating a recession curve.

## Prepare potential evapotranspiration series

Use the method of your choice to compute daily potential evapotraspiration.

Try energy balance calculations for potential evapotranspiration. See Elements of physical hydrology.

AirGR can also calculate it with the Oudinâ€™s formula. The function is `Edaily_Oudin()`


## Irrigation exercise

Good exercise page 255, elements of physical hydrology

## Flood frequency analysis

Use the fitdistrib package to fit some data from the Sogndal valley

Retrieve historical discharge data in Sogndal.
Create a dataset of annual maximum.

Find out about the methodology to compute IVF curves and dio them for Sogndal.
