## Leikanger case study

Calculate the impact on downstream runoff of a new development and try to minimize this impact.


Design the on-site retention measures for the mean flood

Estimate the concentration time and choose the design rain event accordingly.

Design the development-scale retention / infiltration measures for the 20-year flood
Provide safe flow paths for the 200-year flood.

## Sandane case study

they have the option to flood their football filled. Quantify how useful this could be for different flood events.

Evaluate the volume of water than can be stored in the football field. How to control the flow out of this temporary reservoir?
