<h2>Schematics of the hydropower scheme</h2>
<p>Think about possible designs of hydropower schemes that least affect the valley and provide good returns.</p>
<p>You can find information on built water infrastructure on the [NVE Atlas].</p>
<p>They decided to tap into numerous side valleys to the east of Jostedalen, directing water towards a power station at the lower end of the valley. Design potential schemes based on this information.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.statkraft.no/globalassets/old-contains-the-old-folder-structure/documents/jostedal-official-assessment-final-10-may-2013_tcm9-27383.pdf">document</a> you can find a schematic of the design</p>
</section><section id="mean-water-volumes" class="slide level2">
<h2>Mean water volumes</h2>
<p>Use Nevina to calculate the properties of all side catchments flowing into the hydropower infrastructure.</p>
<p>Assuming steady flow conditions, how high would the intake need to be in this side valley?</p>
<p>Calculate how much flow can be achieved in the tunnel</p>
<p>How much flow can be directed from the side-catchments back to the main reservoir by gravity. Will one of the side intake need a non-return valve to avoid a backflow through the intake? Experiment with the behavior of those intakes during various events: intense hourly precipitation, big daily events…</p>
</section><section id="specific-considerations-for-extreme-events" class="slide level2">
<h2>Specific considerations for extreme events</h2>
<p>Do you know other places where hydropower projects have been suggested to help mitigate flooding? Odda</p>
<p>Use NVE Atlas, Norgeskart, Nevina to find the catchments specific to each water intake in Jostedalen.</p>
<p>Calculate much flow can be achieved in the tunnel</p>
<p>How much flow can be directed from the side-catchments back to the main reservoir by gravity. Will one of the side intake need a non-return valve to avoid a backflow through the intake?

<h2>Reconstructing the 1979 flood</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/Power-plants/Norway/Jostedal/">Statkraft presentation of the Jostedalen hydropower scheme</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statkraft.no/media/pressemeldinger/Pressemeldinger-arkiv/2012/statkraft-skrinlegger-overforing-av-vestsideelvene-i-jostedalen/">Statkraft is seeking new consessions on the western side of Jostedalen</a></p>
<p>Information on <a href="https://www.nve.no/hydrologi/bre/bremalinger/massebalansemalinger/nigardsbreen">Nigardsbreen</a></p>
<p>Calculate how much inflow can be expected into the Styggevatnet reservoir during the melt season. You can base yourself on this <a href="http://publikasjoner.nve.no/rapport/2017/rapport2017_76.pdf">document</a>, which present recent mass balance measurements at Austdalsbreen and Nigardsbreen.</p>
<p>Why do you think there is such a big difference in mass balance between Nigardsbreen and Austdalsbreen?</p>

<section id="stream-bank-reinforcement-in-laerdal" class="titleslide slide level1"><h2 class="shout">Stream bank reinforcement in Laerdal</h2></section><section id="background" class="slide level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the 2014 floods, the stream coming out of XX found a new flowpath and destroyed some agricultural land. Which measure would you suggest to avoid such an event in the future?</p>
<p>NVE decided to build a riprap protection on the stretch of stream bank affected. Discuss the potential location of this riprap and calculate its necessary height to protect against a 200 year flood. Hint: <a href="www.nevina.nve.no">Nevina</a> helps you define the catchment area and the 200-year flood. Hint: The riprap protection will have a very controlled geometry, making it easy to use open channel formulas. Hint: For a quite precise measure of steepness, you can use <a href="www.hoydedata.no">hoydedata.no</a>.</p>
<p>What are potential negative downstream impacts of such a measure?</p>
<p>Have a good look at the map in Norgeskart and try to find upstream features that could bring accrued sediments downstream. Hint: The L?rdal tunnel is not far.</p>

<h2>Manning’s equation</h2>
<p>Replacing the last expression for <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> into Chézy’s equation yields:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = {\frac{R_h^{2/3} S^{1/2}}{n}} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the cross-sectional average velocity</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the Manning coefficient. (in <span class="math inline">\(s*m^{-\frac {1}{3}}\)</span>)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_h\)</span> is the hydraulic radius in meters</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the gradient in hydraulic head, which is the channel bed slope when the water depth is constant</p>
