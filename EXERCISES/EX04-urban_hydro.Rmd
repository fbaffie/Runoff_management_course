## Case study: Oslo?

## Residential project in Leikanger

A residential development for 100 houses is planned here. Discuss the existing hydrological condition.
Are there existing streams running through the property?
How easy is it to define their respective catchments?
which risks might become more accute in such catchments with climate change?
Design a first rough outline of the development in terms of roads, house and stormwater infrastructure.
What is the impact of your design?
Which physical / social / economical constraints did you take into account?

Estimate what could be a 20 and a 200-year flood for the stream on the eastern boundary.
Estimate the additional flow your initial flow development plan would add to those storm flows.
Discuss alternative designs that would minimize this.
Be creative: you can draw, add off-the-grid or agricultural features. 


## Case study in Sandane

Should this be an excursion, something to read at home and then an exercise session?
