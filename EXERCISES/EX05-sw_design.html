<ul>
<li>Cut street curb to let SW infiltrate into a sunken mulch basin with native trees</li>
<li>We can guess a drainage grate from the municipal network in the middle of the pedestrian footpath (dirtpath).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="walking-paths-and-lower-roof" class="slide level2">
<h2>Walking paths and lower roof</h2>
<ul>
<li>Home paths discharging into a sunken mulch basin with citrus tree</li>
<li>Raised planting bed doubles as seating area</li>
<li>Salvaged playground ladder</li>
<li>Roof turned into terrace strong enough for many people (30m2 incl. non-terraced part)</li>
<li>Roof painted white to reflect summer heat, and non-toxic</li>
<li>His roof doesn’t have any edges to avoid water falling onto the sides. Maybe the roof is slightly concave</li>

<h2>Higher roof and storage tanks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Water goes into 2*1000 gallons tanks (8000<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> total, 2<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> high x 2<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> each)</li>
<li>Water from higher roof (3<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> high, 50<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>) is gathered into a wet system which discharges onto the lower gutter (2.5<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>), before the tanks</li>
<li>Let’s assume 100<span class="math inline">\(mm\)</span> downspouts</li>

<li>First flush goes into a 2<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> high, 100<span class="math inline">\(mm\)</span> first flush pipe</li>
<li>Screwcap end on this pipe conveniently located close to the entrance, so that he doesn’t forget emptying it</li>
<li>Grape vine to use the dirty (fertilized) water.</li>
<li>Grape will grow over the trellis to shade and cool the tanks</li>
<li>Not mentioned: we can see the pipe out of the bottom of his tanks with 2 valves</li>
<li>Youtube comment: link a slow, drip irrigation setup to the first flush pipe so that you don’t even need to empty it.</li>

</section><section id="storage-overflow-and-greywater" class="slide level2">
<h2>Storage overflow and greywater</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overflow pipe goes behind the fence and into a mulch bed with trees</li>
<li>Not mentioned: there is a black pipe sticking out of the ground at the start of his overflow mulch / tree bed. I think it is his second overflow safety to the SW network There was also one sticking out of his grape (very high though)</li>
<li>Some greywater also discharges into this rather large infiltration bed</li>
<li>Soil care: no sodium soap</li>
<li>4 options for the greywater. Every load sends its water to a different tree</li>
<li>Daylights about the mulch so no roots can grow into the pipe.</li>
<li>Meets the arizona greywater guidelines as the water goes below the mulch: nobody can come in direct contact with standing water</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="wet-system-drainage" class="slide level2">
<h2>Wet system drainage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The wet system can be flushed into the citrus tree (T jonction + screw cap)</li>
<li>The screw cap is also conviniently placed so that he doesn’t forget about it</li>
<li>Be careful with this system in cold climate</li>
<li>I think he should be careful in his climate too as roots like to attack wet pipes</li>
</ul>
<!-- ## Simen's comments: Pro -->
<!-- - If emptied prior to rain flooding events it can reduce the flow spike (very locally) -->
<!-- - Storage of contaminated water to fertilize plants -->
<!-- - Outlet Points in case of periods below freezing to prevent destruction by thaw freeze cycles -->
<!-- ## Simen's comments: Con -->
<!-- - Pipe runs underneath plants unclear whether or not he has accounted for roots destroying the pipe in the wet system -->
<!-- - In the video things get stuck in his filter. this could contaminate the water in the tanks. If this happens emptying the tanks may prove challenging -->
<!-- - If neglected for an extended period of time (vacation) all pipes and tanks may be contaminated and in need of extensive cleaning for further use -->

<h2>Street SW infiltration</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Let’s say his system handles 5m of road width with a 1m wide infiltration strip</li>
<li class="fragment next">So 5<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> of road runoff + 1<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> of infiltration strip needs to infiltrate in 1<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">What is the required infiltration rate to avoid ponding during a 5min 10-year precipitation event (100<span class="math inline">\(l/s\)</span> per Ha)</li>
<li class="fragment next">By infiltration rate, I mean the vertical velocity at which water wil infiltrate into the soil (in <span class="math inline">\(m/s\)</span>). You do not need to relate it to hydraulic conductivity (see <a href="https://fbaffie.github.io/Runoff_management_course/01_Hydrology/2_hydrological_processes_2.html#green-ampt-infiltration-equation">there</a> for the link between infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="street-sw-infiltration-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Street SW infiltration</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">We use the rational formula for the road runoff</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(Q = C*i*A = 0.9*i*A\)</span> we use 0.9 as arunoff coefficient. You could also use 1 if you neglect the small retention and infiltration properties of the asphalt.</li>
<li class="fragment next">Unit conversion: 100l/Ha of precipitation intensity is <span class="math inline">\(0.1m3/s\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(10000m^2\)</span> (1 Ha is <span class="math inline">\(100*100m\)</span>)</li>
<li class="fragment next">So for <span class="math inline">\(5m^2\)</span> of road <span class="math inline">\(Q = C*i*A = 0.9*0.5/10000 = 4.5*10^{-5} m3/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">In addition, <span class="math inline">\(Q = i*A = 0.1*1/10000 = 1*10^{-5} m3/s\)</span> of rain fall onto the infiltrationa area</li>
<li class="fragment next">So in total, for an infiltration area of 1m2, we required an infiltration rate of <span class="math inline">\(4.5*10^{-5}+1*10^{-5} = 5.5*10^{-5} m/s\)</span></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="amount-of-precipitation-to-fill-up-the-tank" class="slide level2">
<h2>Amount of precipitation to fill up the tank</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">We assume <span class="math inline">\(80m^2\)</span> of total roof area. The total storage volume is 8000 liters</li>
<li class="fragment next">How much precipitation is required to fill up the tanks?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="amount-of-precipitation-to-fill-up-the-tank-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Amount of precipitation to fill up the tank</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">1mm of rain is the equivalent of 1<span class="math inline">\(l/m^2\)</span>. So 1<span class="math inline">\(mm\)</span> of rain gives him 80<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> = 0.08<span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">So his tanks will need 8000/80 = 100<span class="math inline">\(mm\)</span> of rain to fill up</li>
<li class="fragment next">Which precipitation event does it correspond to in the Oppstryn IVF?</li>
<li class="fragment next">A 200-year 24h long precipitation event</li>
<li class="fragment next">Considering that it rains approx 300mm/year in Tucson, he can store a lot of the year’s precipitation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infiltration rate required if the tank overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Assume that his tanks are already full when a 5min 10-year precipitation event happens (100<span class="math inline">\(l/s\)</span> per Ha)</li>
<li class="fragment next">Assume that his infiltration mulch bed is 20m2 in area</li>
<li class="fragment next">Which infiltration rate is required to avoid ponding in the infiltration area?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="infiltration-rate-required-if-the-tank-overflows-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Infiltration rate required if the tank overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">If we take a runoff coefficient of 1 for the roofs, the total area contributing precipitation to the infiltration bed is 80m2 of roof + 20m2 of infiltration bed.</li>
<li class="fragment next">So a precipitation intensity of 0.1m3/s for 10000m2 (100l/s per Ha) makes <span class="math inline">\(0.1*100/10000 = 10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span> of inflow into the infiltration area</li>
<li class="fragment next">A 20m2 infiltration area will therefore require an infiltration rate of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3}/20 = 5*10^{-5} m/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">This is consistent with our estimate of the infiltration capacity required for the road-side strip. His setup seems to be coherently sized.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="storage-volume-in-mulch-bed" class="slide level2">
<h2>Storage volume in mulch bed</h2>

<li class="fragment next">Assume that the infiltration area has the previously calculated infiltration capacity: <span class="math inline">\(5*10^{-5}\)</span> m/s</li>
<li class="fragment next">How much ponding storage (height of the paddle in the mulch bed) is needed to handle a 3min 100-year precipitation event (200l/s per Ha)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="storage-volume-in-mulch-bed-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Storage volume in mulch bed</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">Intensity has doubled, so inflow has doubled: <span class="math inline">\(2*10^{-3}\)</span> m3/s of inflow into the infiltration area</li>
<li class="fragment next">Based on the previous exercise, the extra flow (above <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span>) is what the infiltration rate cannot handle: <span class="math inline">\(2*10^{-3}-10^{-3} = 10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">So during 3 min, the accumulated volume that could not infiltrate is: <span class="math inline">\(3*60*10^{-3}= 180*10^{-3}=0.180 m^{3}\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">Spread over 20<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>, this makes a ponding height of: <span class="math inline">\(0.180/20 = 0.009m = 9mm\)</span></li>

<h2>How much flow can the tank inlet convey before the filter overflows</h2>

<li class="fragment next">The first flush pipe is already full</li>
<li class="fragment next">There is a 20<span class="math inline">\(cm\)</span> height difference between the storage inflow pipe and the top of the filter cone / expansion</li>

<h2>How much flow can the tank inlet convey before the filter overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><strong>Important assumptions to discuss</strong>:</li>
<li class="fragment next">It is easier if you assume that the tank is empty. This way you can apply Bernouilli’s equation without having to worry about extra water pressure from the tank as water flows into it (atmospheric pressure only)</li>
<li class="fragment next">This example also includes a big approximation by assuming that the velocity of water at the top of the filter cone is nul. This makes for an easy application of Bernouilli’s Law but generates an underestimation of the water velocity at the tank inlet.</li>

<h2>How much flow can the tank inlet convey before the filter overflows</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><a href="./1_fluid_dynamics.html#exercise-flow-out-of-a-reservoir">There</a>, we calculated the flow out of a reservoir in very similar conditions. In this case, the reservoir is the overflowing filter cone.</li>
<li class="fragment next">This gives us a velocity of <span class="math inline">\(v= (2gd)^{1/2} = 2m/s\)</span> for water falling into the storage tanks. We need to multiply it by the cross-sectional area of the pipe to get the flow rate:</li>
<li class="fragment next">Assuming a 10cm wide pipe: <span class="math inline">\(Q=2*0.05^2 \pi = 0.0157 m^3/s\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">With a capacity of <span class="math inline">\(15.7*10^{-3} m^3/s\)</span>, the inlet to the reservoir has almost 16 times the capacity required to handle a 3min 100-year precipitation event</li>
<li class="fragment next">We neglected head loss but with such as margin, this is not an issue</li>

</section><section id="time-to-empty-the-tank-through-a-10mm-pipe-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Time to empty the tank through a 10mm pipe</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next">As we saw in the previous example, the velocity out of the irrigation hose: <span class="math inline">\(v(t)= (2gh(t))^{1/2}\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">Applying the conservation of mass per increment of time dt:</li>
<li class="fragment next">Flow out of the irrigation hose = A*dh/dt = the area of the tank x small drop in water level (dh) per increment of time (dt)</li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\((2gh(t))^{1/2} * r^2* \pi = A*dh/dt\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">The trick now is to separate <span class="math inline">\(dh\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>, to have only <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dh\)</span> on one side</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="time-to-empty-the-tank-through-a-10mm-pipe-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Time to empty the tank through a 10mm pipe</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(dt= C*h(t)^{-1/2}*dh\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(C=A/(r^2* \pi * (2g)^{1/2})\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next">This way, we can easily integrate both sides of the equation between <span class="math inline">\(t_{end} \ and \ t_0\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(t_{end}-t_0 = 2*C*(h_{top}^{1/2}-h_{bottom}^{1/2})\)</span></li>
<li class="fragment next"><span class="math inline">\(h_{bottom}\)</span> is our reference elevation so it is nul. This yields:</li>
