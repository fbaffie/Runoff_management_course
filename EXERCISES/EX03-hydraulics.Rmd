## Case study: Jostedal

Use NVE Atlas, Norgeskart, Nevina to find the catchments specific to each water intake in Jostedalen.


What is the mean residence time at water in the Styggevatn reservoir?
What is the mean residence time in the Leirdal reservoir?
Which management problems are linked to the situation in Leirdal?
Discuss how Statkraft can best optimize the Leirdal reservoir

The population was happy that a dam was built in order to control floods (i.e. [1979 flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GDCZ-O6UbA)). Statkraft was allowed to built as long as they provided enough extra capacity at all times to cover an exeptional event. The top reservoir is therefore never full.

## Schematics of the hydropower scheme

Think about possible designs of hydropower schemes that least affect the valley and provide good returns.

You can find information on built water infrastructure on the [NVE Atlas].


They decided to tap into numerous side valleys to the east of Jostedalen, directing water towards a power station at the lower end of the valley. Design potential schemes based on this information.

In this [document](https://www.statkraft.no/globalassets/old-contains-the-old-folder-structure/documents/jostedal-official-assessment-final-10-may-2013_tcm9-27383.pdf) you can find a schematic of the design

## Mean water volumes

Use Nevina to calculate the properties of all side catchments flowing into the hydropower infrastructure.

Assuming steady flow conditions, how high would the intake need to be in this side valley?

Calculate how much flow can be achieved in the tunnel

How much flow can be directed from the side-catchments back to the main reservoir by gravity.
Will one of the side intake need a non-return valve to avoid a backflow through the intake?
Experiment with the behavior of those intakes during various events: intense hourly precipitation, big daily events...

## Specific considerations for extreme events

Do you know other places where hydropower projects have been suggested to help mitigate flooding?
Odda

## Reconstructing the 1979 flood

Information on [Nigardsbreen](https://www.nve.no/hydrologi/bre/bremalinger/massebalansemalinger/nigardsbreen)


Calculate how much inflow can be expected into the Styggevatnet reservoir during the melt season.
You can base yourself on this [document](http://publikasjoner.nve.no/rapport/2017/rapport2017_76.pdf), which present recent mass balance measurements at Austdalsbreen and Nigardsbreen.

Why do you think there is such a big difference in mass balance between Nigardsbreen and Austdalsbreen?




In this tutorial, you will learn how to summarise a table of data, including:

* How to summarise tables with `summarise()` 
* How to recognize the most useful families of functions to combine with `summarise()`
* How to combine multiple dplyr operations with the pipe, `%>%`
* How to compute counts of observations with `n()`
* How to summarise groups of observations with `group_by()` and `summarise()`

The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.6.
