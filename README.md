# Runoff management course

This repository contains most presentation material for the course *runoff management* of the Master in *climate change management* 
at HÃ¸gskulen for Vestlandet (HVL), Norway.

The presentations have been prepared in the R Markdown format with the held of the `rmdshower` [package](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/rmdshower).

The course website is not online anymore. You can download the gh-pages branch for a local copy.

## References
I have used pictures gleaned from the internet and have on most occasions not referenced them directly within the course material to keep it simple. All the source websites and pictures are however listed in my pinterest collections:

Credits for sources that are not in the pinterest collections are listed [there](https://fbaffie.github.io/Runoff_management_course/#referencing-credits).

If a reference is missing, or you are unhappy about the use of an image, please raise an issue.

## Collaboration
If you find the course design interesting, be it the course content or the open source text-based philosophy; please fork this repository and create a pull request if you have suggestions for improvement.

## Wishlist
I did not only choose to develop a web-based course because it could be shared online.
There are also many html / javascript visualization libraries (i.e. R htmlwidgets) that can make this content more interactive.
Things like:
- exploring the impact of different hydrological models on various catchments (from simple to complex).
- interactive map tools
- linking plots, tables and maps with R crosstalk
- Exercise sessions using the `learnr` package
